      <p>NSmen/NSF Alumni Sharing Session 2019<br>

Educating our students on the importance of National Service (NS) is a key component of National Education (NE) and Character and Citizenship Education (CCE). On 16 August 2019, Yio Chu Kang Secondary School collaborated with the SAF and Home Team to invite alumni to engage our students on their National Service (NS) experience.<br> 

Together with the officers from the Army, our Alumni, Dustin Wong, Chia Yi You and Muhammad Aliff Adha Bin Rosli engaged our students with their personal encounters. In order to make the session relevant to the girls, female officers were invited to share on their journey.<br> 

Good rapport was built when the students responded enthusiastically and positively. There was continuous string of questions asked on matters ranging from pre-enlistment procedures and preparation, to life during BMT, the process of becoming a regular National Serviceman and lasting comradeship formed during NS.<br> 

This engagement session helped our younger generation – Sec 3 students to better appreciate and understand the importance of National Service (NS) also provided information on how male students can start preparing for NS. As for the girls, they learnt how they could support their spouse or explore army careers in the future.<br>

<p> On 21 September 2018, it marked the inaugural Homecoming 2018 – Lantern Nite for Yio Chu Kang Secondary School. Almost 200 Alumni and Staff had a great time mingling, reminiscing old memories and forging new friendships. Highlights of the night included tea & mooncake appreciation, origami lantern making & well-wishes writing as well as a lantern parade. It was also a nostalgic trip down memory lane for those who went on a tour to old Chong Boon Secondary site. The building might have changed but the fond memories were still so vivid for them.<br><br>
