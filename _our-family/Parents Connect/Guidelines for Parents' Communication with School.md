At YCKSS, we value working closely with parents to nurture our students’ holistic development and well-being. Parents can use the following official modes of communication with the school:      

* Phone (General Office): 64560669
* Email: [yckss@moe.edu.sg](mailto:yckss@moe.edu.sg)
* Mailing Address: 3063 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5, Singapore 569868

Our teachers are key to the culture of care that is pervasive in the school as they balance their time to engage parents with teaching lessons and the various other duties in school. We encourage parents to communicate and engage with teachers only during school hours **(8am - 5pm), on working weekdays and during school terms.** Teachers are not expected to respond to parents’ and students’ queries after school hours, during the weekends and school holidays. Teachers are also not expected to provide their personal mobile numbers to parents / students.

For urgent messages to teachers, please contact the school’s General Office, should the teachers be engaged and are uncontactable during school hours. Parents are encouraged to make appointments for face-to-face meetings with teachers by contacting the General Office to avoid
disruptions to teachers’ duties.
