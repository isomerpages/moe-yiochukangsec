**Parents Connect** plays the key enabling role of **connecting parents** with the **school**, their **child** and other **parents**.  
  
The goals of Parents Connect are as follows.  
  

*   To build bridges for positive partnerships between the school, parents and alumni through organising meaningful activities and supporting school events.  
    
*   To offer a platform for parents to share unique skills and volunteer their time for their children whilst building friendships with other parents.  
    

  
Parents of past and present students are still connected on Facebook – [YCKSS PSG](https://www.facebook.com/groups/641464419329743/). Parents may request to join the community.
