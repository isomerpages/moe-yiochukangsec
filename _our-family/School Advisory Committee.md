The School Advisory Committee (SAC) was newly formed after the merger of Yio Chu Kang Secondary School and Chong Boon Secondary School in 2018. The new committee is made up of members from both former schools' committee, and they aim to help bring out the best in our school and students. Their many contributions include the SAC-YCKSS Resilience award. This award was initiated by the SAC in 2018 to recognize students who have been able to achieve excellence against all odds and challenges.
