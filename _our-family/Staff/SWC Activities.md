<b>Title of activity:</b> EAS Learning Day<br>

<b>Description of event:</b><br>  

Did you spend the December holidays cooking up a storm in the kitchen? For the EAS, 2 December 2020, was the day they donned aprons and became chefs in a special culinary workshop they attended in school. Look at the all the dishes they managed to whip up! Stuffed Portobello mushroom, chicken sliders, brownies, and cheesecake cups. Is your mouth watering yet?<br><br>

<b>Title of activity:</b> Joy of Learning<br>

<b>Description of event:</b><br>

When was the last time you felt like a complete amateur when learning a new skill, feeling the joy (and the embarrassment) of being a complete novice with that willingness to look foolish, to struggle and ask questions, and to be mediocre at something yet be unafraid to experiment and try?<br>

1 September 2021, Wednesday was the <b>Joy of Learning Day</b>, a day of making learning fun, engaging and challenging for staff. It was planned by SWC in collaboration with the Design & Technology unit. Instructions were given online for staff to have an exciting journey to create a “Magic Box”.<br>

The staff room was abuzz with activity, laughter, questions and that occasional ‘squeal’.<br>
	
<img style="width:100%;height:50%" src="/images/Our%20Family/Staff/SWC%20Activities/Social/S7.png"><br><br>
	
It was a memorable day of bonding. There were 'wow’ moments when staff finally completed the Bluetooth Speakers and saw how they work just as good as the commercially produced ones. There were ‘ta-da’ moments of mock fanfare even when the speaker ended up without a Bluetooth connection as wires just couldn’t connect (like mine).<br><br>

The grouping for the bowling activity was done so that every team had a mixed number of bowlers from school leaders to the EAS staff. There was much bonding during the event.

At the end of the day, hidden talents in bowling emerged and the rest had a very joyful day.<br>
