<b>Title of activity:</b> EAS Learning Day<br>

<b>Description of event:</b><br>  

Did you spend the December holidays cooking up a storm in the kitchen? For the EAS, 2 December 2020, was the day they donned aprons and became chefs in a special culinary workshop they attended in school. Look at the all the dishes they managed to whip up! Stuffed Portobello mushroom, chicken sliders, brownies, and cheesecake cups. Is your mouth watering yet?<br><br>

<b>Title of activity:</b> Joy of Learning<br>

<b>Description of event:</b><br>

When was the last time you felt like a complete amateur when learning a new skill, feeling the joy (and the embarrassment) of being a complete novice with that willingness to look foolish, to struggle and ask questions, and to be mediocre at something yet be unafraid to experiment and try?<br>

1 September 2021, Wednesday was the <b>Joy of Learning Day</b>, a day of making learning fun, engaging and challenging for staff. It was planned by SWC in collaboration with the Design & Technology unit. Instructions were given online for staff to have an exciting journey to create a “Magic Box”.<br>

The staff room was abuzz with activity, laughter, questions and that occasional ‘squeal’.<br>

It was a memorable day of bonding. There were 'wow’ moments when staff finally completed the Bluetooth Speakers and saw how they work just as good as the commercially produced ones. There were ‘ta-da’ moments of mock fanfare even when the speaker ended up without a Bluetooth connection as wires just couldn’t connect (like mine).<br><br>

	<b>Description of event:</b><br>

To welcome the TIGER New Year and to encourage bonding among the staff, the SWC organized a CNY Calligraphy session for staff on the 13 January 2022, Thursday. About 40 staff participated in the session.<br>

<b>Title of activity:</b> Durian Feast<br>   

<b>Description of event:</b><br>

At the durian feast held on 31st July 2019, our staff were spoiled for choices. With a variety of fruits to choose from, the King of fruits was definitely the favourite. Staff who tried the Mao Shan Wang (MSW) durian, known to be the premium type, commented on its rich, bitter and heavily rich flavour/<br>

It was indeed a great way to end the day and we had an enjoyable bonding session over the feasting.<br><br>

<b>Title of activity:</b> Manito-Manitee Game<br>

<b>Description of event:</b><br> 

During the month of September, we played the Manito-Manitee Game ( Angel-Mortal) to encourage a caring environment in the school and to enhance staff bonding. All staff ( teaching and non-teaching) were randomly paired and everyone had to take care of their appointed Manitee, for a month. Many gave gifts and wrote encouraging notes to brighten up the day, but they would remain anonymous until revelation day, which was Teachers' Day. There were hand made gifts and improvised wrapping papers , well thought and nicely wrapped up snacks and useful stationery.<br>

All in all, most staff gave positive feedback and are looking forward to more of such engaging activities in future.<br><br>
