<h3>Staff Appreciation Week: Grateful Moments, Lasting Impact</h3>

<p><i>“It’s my life~~~” Bon Jovi’s</i> song rang out as the principal joined in the groove, signaling the official yet fun start of the Staff Appreciation Lunch. With the microphone in hand, groups eagerly showcased their unique identities – flaunting glossy balloons, rocking cool shades, or sporting bandana scarves. The royal blue attire, paired with tiaras or songkoks, added a dash of flair, as everyone embraced the theme of ‘Be Yourself.’</p>

<p>As the delectable eight-course feast unfolded, the room buzzed with excitement, spurred on by a battery of games. Fearless and fun-loving souls dressed up as Albert Einstein, Ninja Turtle, Phua Chu Kang, Wonder Woman or Pikachu with whatever their tablemates could find. The invitees also uncovered each other's hidden talents and passions: Who blesses people with self-made pineapple tarts? Who is an intrepid traveler and converses in Japanese effortlessly?  Whose home is a kitty paradise? Whether or not you know these answers, the YCKSS family was awestruck by the versatility and delightful surprises of those in the very same room. Even the conventional lucky draw had an uncannily unconventional twist, leaving everyone beaming as winners of vouchers, big wads or not.</p>

<p>Thanks to the hilariously funny emcees, laughter and cheers permeated the venue, filling Holiday Inn @ Atrium with a sense of camaraderie that truly defined the luncheon on 28 August.</p>

<p>But the luncheon was not the only highlight! In the days leading up to the event, cards of gratitude and gifts of choice – epitomising the SPICEY framework – were lovingly handed out, radiating warmth and sending a pellucidly clear message to every member of the YCKSS family: You are never alone in this.</p>
	
	
<h3>Mini Durian Delights</h3>

<p>The air buzzed with anticipation when a hint of its presence was dropped through a text message. Upon its arrival, the atmosphere intensified; some rushed up to it with their like-minded colleagues, while others scrunched up their noses yet politely declined, saying, ‘I would give it a miss.’ It is none other than the king of fruits – durian!</p>

<p>On the 28th of June 2024, staff were greeted by the strong and distinct aroma of durians. Enthusiasts revelled in its rich and creamy texture, especially in the company of other durian lovers at the Heritage Gallery. Whether the unique aroma elicited adoration or aversion, everyone had either the king of fruits or other delectable fruits to savour that day. While durians may reign supreme in the hearts of many fruit lovers, they did not overshadow the significance of the shared experience among us in the teaching fraternity.</p>

<h3>Embracing the Spirit of Hari Raya</h3>


<p>Hari Raya festivities are synonymous with an exquisite array of culinary delights. It was no exception this year, with the primary aim of fostering YCKSS familial ties. On 19 April, as the aroma of tantalising lunch filled the air, it set the perfect backdrop for colleagues to engage in hearty conversations amidst their busy lives.</p>

<p>Gathered in the cozy comfort of the Dance Studio 2, we revelled in the light-hearted stories steeped in history and practices of Muslims. While it culminated in quizzes that challenged our knowledge and wit, the winners brought home some mementos that served as vivid reminders of the generosity and inclusivity embedded within the Muslim culture.</p>

<h3>Chinese New Year Celebrations 2024</h3>


<p>To usher in the Year of the Dragon, all YCKSS staff convened in a calligraphy session on 2 February 2024. Empowered with creative autonomy, everyone carefully and meticulously penned auspicious words of their choice and engaged in the delicate art of paper cutting, reflecting personalised aspirations. The celebration would not be complete without the venerable tradition of Lo Hei on 16 February 2024, when a myriad of ingredients were tossed with one collective purpose: ringing in peace and prosperity in the coming year.</p>

<h3> Manito-Manitee Game</h3>


	<p>During the month of September, we played the Manito-Manitee Game (Angel-Mortal) to encourage a caring environment in the school and to enhance staff bonding. All staff (teaching and non-teaching)* were randomly paired and everyone had to take care of their appointed Manitee, for a month. Many gave gifts and wrote encouraging notes to brighten up the day, but they would remain anonymous until revelation day, which was Teachers' Day. There were hand made gifts and improvised wrapping papers , well thought and nicely wrapped up snacks and useful stationery.</p>
	
<p>All in all, most staff gave positive feedback and are looking forward to more of such engaging activities in future.</p>

<h3>Potluck Breakfast Session</h3>


<p>The staff welfare committee had organised a Brunch Potluck session during Marking Day. Food has always been a successful way to bring staff from different department together. Every department was invited to bring a few different types of food. There was a splendid array of food on the table. Staff enjoyed themselves.</p>

<h3>Run for Your ‘Life’</h3>


<blockquote> ‘Stretch! Swing! Skip! Squat!’ ...</blockquote>

<p>These were some of the warm-up exercises that a group of staff performed before commencing their 14 th MOE Olive Run at Singapore Sports Hub, OCBC Square, on 13 July 2024. Whether or not their counterparts were dashing past them toward the finishing line, they remained focused on their personal pace, form, and even the enjoyment of
the scenic beauty around them. Ultimately, their primary goal in joining the activity was to stay fit and healthy. Anything else, such as refreshments, goodie bags, complimentary fitness check, and even lucky draw prizes, was a bonus but secondary. After all, health is the greatest wealth.</p>

<h3>Yoga: Ignite Your Mind, Body and Soul!</h3>


<p>Armed with water bottles, towels, and even yoga mats, the staff soldiered on to the sacred sanctuaries where tranquil melodies and revitalising yoga awaited on an ordinary Friday, 1 March 2024. Namaste!</p>

<p>Having greeted the yoga teachers respectfully, some traversed along an infinity pattern gracefully in the cavernous hall, while others curled their toes and lifted their hips methodically in the cozy studio. The rewards were immense – radiant smiles across the faces, beads of perspiration testament to a vigorous workout and last but not least, a much-cherished respite from the hustle and bustle of life.</p>

<h3> Staff Appreciation Day 5th Sept</h3>


<p>The grouping for the bowling activity was done so that every team had a mixed number of bowlers from school leaders to the EAS staff. There was much bonding during the event. It was an event that favoured no male or female bowlers. All 120 bowlers had an equal chance of doing well for the team. At the end of the day, hidden talents in bowling emerged and the rest had a very joyful day.</p>

<h3>Durian Feast</h3>

<p>At the durian feast held on 31st July 2019, our staff were spoiled for choices. With a variety of fruits to choose from, the King of fruits was definitely the favourite. Staff who tried the Mao Shan Wang (MSW) durian, known to be the premium type, commented on its rich, bitter and heavily rich flavour.</p>

<p>It was indeed a great way to end the day and we had an enjoyable bonding session over the feasting.</p>
