### Title of Activity : Chinese New Year Celebrations 2024

Description of event :

To usher in the Year of the Dragon, all YCKSS staff convened in a calligraphy session on 2 February 2024.

### Title of Activity : Joy of Learning

Description of event :

When was the last time you felt like a complete amateur when learning a new skill, feeling the joy (and the embarrassment) of being a complete novice with that willingness to look foolish, to struggle and ask questions, and to be mediocre at something yet be unafraid to experiment and try?

1 September 2021, Wednesday was the **Joy of Learning Day**, a day of making learning fun, engaging and challenging for staff. It was planned by SWC in collaboration with the Design &amp; Technology unit. Instructions were given online for staff to have an exciting journey to create a "Magic Box".

The staff room was abuzz with activity, laughter, questions and that occasional 'squeal'.

#### Quotes from participants

It was a memorable day of bonding. There were 'wow' moments when staff finally completed the Bluetooth Speakers and saw how they work just as good as the commercially produced ones. There were 'ta-da' moments of mock fanfare even when the speaker ended up without a Bluetooth connection as wires just couldn't connect (like mine).

During the month of September, we played the Manito-Manitee Game *(Angel-Mortal)* to encourage a caring environment in the school and to enhance staff bonding. All staff *(teaching and non-teaching)* were randomly paired and everyone had to take care of their appointed Manitee, for a month. Many gave gifts and wrote encouraging notes to brighten up the day, but they would remain anonymous until revelation day, which was Teachers' Day. There were hand made gifts and improvised wrapping papers , well thought and nicely wrapped up snacks and useful stationery.

All in all, most staff gave positive feedback and are looking forward to more of such engaging activities in future.

## PHYSICAL

### Title of Activity : Yoga: Ignite Your Mind, Body and Soul!

Description of event :

Armed with water bottles, towels, and even yoga mats, the staff soldiered on to the sacred sanctuaries where tranquil melodies and revitalising yoga awaited on an ordinary Friday, 1 March 2024. Namaste!

Having greeted the yoga teachers respectfully, some traversed along an infinity pattern gracefully in the cavernous hall, while others curled their toes and lifted their hips methodically in the cozy studio. The rewards were immense – radiant smiles across the faces, beads of perspiration testament to a vigorous workout and last but not least, a much-cherished respite from the hustle and bustle of life.

At the end of the day, hidden talents in bowling emerged and the rest had a very joyful day.
