### Title of Activity:  Embracing the Spirit of Hari Raya

Description of event :

Hari Raya festivities are synonymous with an exquisite array of culinary delights. It was no exception this year, with the primary aim of fostering YCKSS familial ties. On 19 April, as the aroma of tantalising lunch filled the air, it set the perfect backdrop for colleagues to engage in hearty conversations amidst their busy lives.

Gathered in the cozy comfort of the Dance Studio 2, we revelled in the light-hearted stories steeped in history and practices of Muslims. While it culminated in quizzes that challenged our knowledge and wit, the winners brought home some mementos that served as vivid reminders of the generosity and inclusivity embedded within the Muslim culture.

### Title of Activity : Chinese New Year Celebrations 2024

Description of event :

To usher in the Year of the Dragon, all YCKSS staff convened in a calligraphy session on 2 February 2024. Empowered with creative autonomy, everyone carefully and meticulously penned auspicious words of their choice and engaged in the delicate art of paper cutting, reflecting personalised aspirations. The celebration would not be complete without the venerable tradition of Lo Hei on 16 February 2024, when a myriad of ingredients were tossed with one collective purpose: ringing in peace and prosperity in the coming year.

### Title of Activity : EAS Learning Day

Description of event :

Did you spend the December holidays cooking up a storm in the kitchen?

### Title of Activity : Joy of Learning

Description of event :

When was the last time you felt like a complete amateur when learning a new skill, feeling the joy (and the embarrassment) of being a complete novice with that willingness to look foolish, to struggle and ask questions, and to be mediocre at something yet be unafraid to experiment and try?

1 September 2021, Wednesday was the **Joy of Learning Day**, a day of making learning fun, engaging and challenging for staff. It was planned by SWC in collaboration with the Design &amp; Technology unit. Instructions were given online for staff to have an exciting journey to create a "Magic Box".

The staff room was abuzz with activity, laughter, questions and that occasional 'squeal'.

#### Quotes from participants

It was a memorable day of bonding. There were 'wow' moments when staff finally completed the Bluetooth Speakers and saw how they work just as good as the commercially produced ones. There were 'ta-da' moments of mock fanfare even when the speaker ended up without a Bluetooth connection as wires just couldn't connect (like mine).

### Title of Activity : Durian Feast

It was indeed a great way to end the day and we had an enjoyable bonding session over the feasting.

### Title of Activity : Manito-Manitee Game

Description of event :

During the month of September, we played the Manito-Manitee Game *(Angel-Mortal)* to encourage a caring environment in the school and to enhance staff bonding. All staff *(teaching and non-teaching)* were randomly paired and everyone had to take care of their appointed Manitee, for a month. Many gave gifts and wrote encouraging notes to brighten up the day, but they would remain anonymous until revelation day, which was Teachers' Day. There were hand made gifts and improvised wrapping papers , well thought and nicely wrapped up snacks and useful stationery.

All in all, most staff gave positive feedback and are looking forward to more of such engaging activities in future.

## PHYSICAL

### Title of Activity : Yoga: Ignite Your Mind, Body and Soul!

Description of event :

Armed with water bottles, towels, and even yoga mats, the staff soldiered on to the sacred sanctuaries where tranquil melodies and revitalising yoga awaited on an ordinary Friday, 1 March 2024. Namaste!

Having greeted the yoga teachers respectfully, some traversed along an infinity pattern gracefully in the cavernous hall, while others curled their toes and lifted their hips methodically in the cozy studio. The rewards were immense â€“ radiant smiles across the faces, beads of perspiration testament to a vigorous workout and last but not least, a much-cherished respite from the hustle and bustle of life.

### Title of Activity : Staff Appreciation Day 5th Sept

Description of event :

The grouping for the bowling activity was done so that every team had a mixed number of bowlers from school leaders to the EAS staff. There was much bonding during the event. It was an event that favoured no male or female bowlers. All 120 bowlers had an equal chance of doing well for the team. At the end of the day, hidden talents in bowling emerged and the rest had a very joyful day.
