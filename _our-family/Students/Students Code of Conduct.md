<p> <b>ATTIRE</b><br><br>

  

<b>School Uniform</b><br>  

The uniform is a representation of the school and its history. The school uniform is to be worn in a dignified manner that befits a YCKSian.<br>

Students are to wear the prescribed school uniform in school and during all school functions whether inside or outside the school. Modification to the uniform is strictly not allowed.<br>

For the girls, the length of the skirt must be worn no shorter than 2 finger widths above the knee. For the boys, the pants should not be shortened beyond students’ ankles.<br><br>

<b>PE Attire</b><br>  
Only the school PE T-shirt and shorts are to be worn for PE lessons unless permission has been granted. Students must change into their school uniform during the first available break.<br><br>

<b>Level T-shirt</b><br>  
Students can only wear the Level T-shirt meant for that level.  This can only be worn on days when there are early school dismissals such as on Chinese New Year’s Eve, Sports Carnival, National Day Celebration and Teacher’s Day Celebration.<br><br>

<b>CCA Attire</b><br>  
Only approved CCA attire or PE attire is allowed for CCAs.<br><br>

<b>Cardigans/ Sweaters</b><br>  
Cardigans must not be worn except in air-conditioned rooms. Students who are feeling unwell should rest in the Sick Bay.<br><br>

<b>Religious Items</b><br>  
Wearing of religious items is not allowed as the school is a secular public space for all students.<br><br>

<b>Footwear</b><br>  
Only school approved white shoes and white socks are allowed. Socks must be visibly worn. Sports shoes may be worn for CCAs and on special occasion such as the School Sports Carnival, with permission from the teacher-in-charge.<br><br>

<b>GROOMING</b><br><br>

<b>ATTITUDE</b><br><br>

  

<b>Conduct and Behaviour</b><br>

Students are to be courteous, respectful and well-behaved at all times.<br><br>  

  

<b>Morning Assembly</b><br>  
All students are to report to school by 7.25 a.m. sharp.      

Students who are Singapore citizens must sing the National Anthem and take the Pledge. Students will take the Pledge with the right fist over the heart.<br><br>

  

<b>Possession of Weapon</b><br>  
All students are not allowed to have in their possession any weapon.  
They are also not allowed to bring any weapon-like item that may distract or make the school an unsafe place.<br><br>    
  
<b>Use of Mobile Devices</b><br>  
The rules and policies governing the use of mobile devices in the school aim to ensure the school community is a safe place for all students and staff, for students to learn values and self-management skills, and for learning to take place with fewer distractions. Mobile devices are not to be used as audio/ gaming devices.<br><br>    
  
<b>Use of mobile devices</b><br>
	including, but not limited to, mobile phones, tablets and laptops <b>must be switched off</b> and kept in the school bag or pocket <b>once students enter the school compound.</b><br>  

<b>For the duration of curriculum time</b>, the mobile devices <b>must remain switched off</b>. This includes recess, remedials, enrichment programmes, workshops and CCAs unless authorised by teacher. <b>After curriculum hours</b>, students can use mobile devices only in the foyer (outside General Office) and canteen.<br>  

  
Students who urgently need to contact parents can use the phone in the General Office. Parents can contact their children through at 6456 0669 during office hours.<br>  

  
No unauthorised use, modifications, uploading or distribution of audio, image and video recordings are allowed in any form, unless explicit permission has been sought and given.<br>  
  
Any violation or suspected inappropriate use of the mobile device will result in the device being withheld and checked as a disciplinary measure or for the purpose of investigation.   The school shall not be responsible for the loss of any personal equipment or possession.<br><br>
	
<b>ATTENDANCE</b><br><br>

  

All students must attend lessons, CCAs, school events and activities regularly and punctually.<br>

Absence from school as a result of illness must be supported by a valid Medical Certificate or letter from a certified doctor or medical specialist to be given to the Form Teacher promptly on the day the student returns to school.<br>

A letter from the parent/ guardian will only be accepted if it is followed up by the parent/ guardian's call to the office on the day of the student's absence.<br>

A copy of the Medical Certificate is also expected to be given to Subject Teacher(s) if it concerns any assessment (class assessment or school examination). Students without a medical certificate or valid reason for absence from any assessment will be awarded a zero mark.<br>

Absence from school, lessons, CCAs, any activities planned by the school without leave or valid reason is considered truancy. Prompt submission of document to support the absence is critical.<br><br>  

<b>ASSIGNMENTS and SCHOOL WORK</b><br>

  
All students are to:<br>  

*   Study diligently and conscientiously and to take pride in their work.<br>  
    
*   Complete all schoolwork/homework assigned to them and to submit them on time.

    <label for="accordion2">Disciplinary Guidelines</label>

    <div>

      <p> Every action has consequences. Students who break the Code of Conduct will be disciplined. Helping students realise this is one way we can empower our students to develop self-management. It is therefore important to understand the consequences for not abiding by the rules and regulations.

The following list shows the guidelines for managing disciplinary offences and violation of the Code of Conduct. The list is not exhaustive and is subject to changes. The school reserves the right to determine the disciplinary consequences in the context of each case.
