#### **DSA-SEC Home**

Yio Chu Kang Secondary School believes in a well-rounded education and is committed to providing learning opportunities beyond the core academic and student development programmes.

The school has vacancies for up to 20% of our Secondary 1 cohort in 2023 for the DSA-Sec programme. Interested students can apply through the DSA process.

Students who are successfully admitted to the school via DSA are expected to honour their commitment to the school, and participate in the activities related to the talent they are selected for from year 1 to 4.

In DSA-Sec Exercise 2022, we are looking for promising Primary Six students or students not studying in MOE mainstream primary schools who demonstrate special talents in the following areas:
