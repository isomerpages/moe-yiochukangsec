YCKSS taps into the community resources and platforms to create opportunities to enhance our students’ learning experiences beyond school. We actively seek to collaborate and engage in community activities and it is evidenced from the various events our students participated such as SYF Celebrations Festival Concert in 2018 and Yio Chu Kang Community Club National Day Observance Day 2018, etc.

To find out more details of each activity, please go to [The Horizon (Our Newsletter)](https://yiochukangsec.moe.edu.sg/our-experience/the-horizon-newsletter) and also our [YCKSS Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/yiochukangsec) and [Instagram Posts](https://www.instagram.com/yoloyio/) for the latest updates.

Look out for the more details in [The Horizon, Issue 2](/files/In%20Our%20Community/The%20Horizon%20Issue%202%20(July%20-%20Nov%202018).pdf).
