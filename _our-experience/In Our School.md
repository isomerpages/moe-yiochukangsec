**YCKSS in COVID-19 (Special Edition for 2020)**  
A very exciting and challenging year for everyone indeed! Three videos were produced to document our journey right from the start. Each video focuses on what students and staff experienced and the activities they participated in. Ever wondered how teachers taught from home or how students kept themselves healthy or how Teacher’s Day was celebrated this year? Then check out our [videos](https://yiochukangsec.moe.edu.sg/our-experience/the-horizon-newsletter) to see how things are the same yet different.

**Level Camps**  
The Level Camps aim to bond the Form Teachers and the class through out of classroom experiences. Held over 2 – 3 days, the camps create a common experience for all students, and strengthen school’s identity and belonging. They also build positive Teacher-Student Relationship. Through these activities, we help students discover the joy of learning.

**Health Fiesta Week and Sports Carnival**  
Health Fiesta, which culminates in Sports Carnival Day, is a week-long event that is much anticipated by the students. It enhances students’ engagement in physical robustness and healthy lifestyle through a variety of fun and simple activities. There is no better medium than Sports to enhance social cohesion and interaction for students from all levels to interact.

**Showtime**  
Showtime gives students an avenue for self-expression because of the talents emerging from the school’s Arts, Media and Design Programme. Showtime provides a conducive space for students after school to entertain their peers, performing in an informal setting with full technical facilities. It is held twice a year, with one Showtime each semester.
