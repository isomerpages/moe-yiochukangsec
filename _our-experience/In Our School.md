## YCKSS in COVID-19 (Special Edition for 2020) 
A very exciting and challenging year for everyone indeed! Three videos were produced to document our journey right from the start. Each video focuses on what students and staff experienced and the activities they participated in. Ever wondered how teachers taught from home or how students kept themselves healthy or how Teacher’s Day was celebrated this year? Then check out our&nbsp;[videos](https://yiochukangsec.moe.edu.sg/our-experience/the-horizon-newsletter) to see how things are the same yet different.

## Level Camps
The Level Camps aim to bond the Form Teachers and the class through out of classroom experiences. Held over 2 – 3 days, the camps create a common experience for all students, and strengthen school’s identity and belonging. They also build positive Teacher-Student Relationship. Through these activities, we help students discover the joy of learning.

### Showtime 
Showtime gives students an avenue for self-expression because of the talents emerging from the school’s Arts, Media and Design Programme. Showtime provides a conducive space for students after school to entertain their peers, performing in an informal setting with full technical facilities. It is held twice a year, with one Showtime each semester.

### Speech and Prize Giving Day  
Our annual Speech and Prize Giving Day is a time to recognise the good work by the school and our graduating cohort of students. In addition, it is also a celebration of our students’ talents as all the performing arts groups such as the Dances, Choir, Band and Drama will put up an amazing concert that always leaves the audience asking for more.

### Singapore Youth Festival  
The Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) is an annual event organised by the Ministry of Education to celebrate the vitality of our youth and their diverse artistic talents. Our performing arts groups are always excited to be a part of this celebration and though it entails many months of intense training and practices, the students find it a joy to finally showcase their works of excellence. Watch the highlights of their journey in the video or visit our official Youtube channel for their full performances.

### Safety and Security Exercises 
School safety, security and care are taken seriously. Security exercises and fire drills are conducted regularly so that staff and students can respond with confidence and calm in an emergency.
