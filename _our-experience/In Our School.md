Showtime gives students an avenue for self-expression because of the talents emerging from the school’s Arts, Media and Design Programme. Showtime provides a conducive space for students after school to entertain their peers, performing in an informal setting with full technical facilities. It is held twice a year, with one Showtime each semester.

The Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) is an annual event organised by the Ministry of Education to celebrate the vitality of our youth and their diverse artistic talents. Our performing arts groups are always excited to be a part of this celebration and though it entails many months of intense training and practices, the students find it a joy to finally showcase their works of excellence. Watch the highlights of their journey in the video or visit our official Youtube channel for their full performances.
