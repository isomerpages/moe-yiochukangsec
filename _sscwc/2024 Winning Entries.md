<p>Synopsis: In today’s digital world, we are all at risk of exposure to
scams, including impersonation and phishing schemes. Cybercriminals often
disguise themselves as trusted figures, exploiting our trust to gather
sensitive information such as bank details, passwords, or personal data.
These scams can be very sophisticated, and victims may not realize they’ve
been scammed until it’s too late, leading to serious financial loss, emotional
distress, or even<strong> </strong>damage to one’s reputation. As responsible
members of a digital society, it’s crucial for each of us to play a role
in combating these threats. By spreading awareness and educating ourselves
and others, we can reduce the chances of falling victim to such scams.
Additionally, we should protect ourselves by being cautious online, verifying
identities, and never believing offers or deals that seem too good to be
true. Together, we can create a safer digital environment for everyone.
Be alert in the cyberworld!</p>

<p>Synopsis: The video shows that you can’t trust anybody you see online
because anybody can pretend to be someone they are not on the internet.
In this video, it shows a teenage girl who befriends somebody she don’t
know online and plans to meet her after realising that they are in the
same school. The online friend she befriended was actually a stalker who
planned to kidnap her. The key message that we want to get across is to
be safe online and to not trust people online that we do not know.</p>
