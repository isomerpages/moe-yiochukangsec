<p><strong>Synopsis:</strong> In today’s digital world, we are all at risk
of exposure to scams, including impersonation and phishing schemes. Cybercriminals
often disguise themselves as trusted figures, exploiting our trust to gather
sensitive information such as bank details, passwords, or personal data.
These scams can be very sophisticated, and victims may not realize they’ve
been scammed until it’s too late, leading to serious financial loss, emotional
distress, or even<strong> </strong>damage to one’s reputation. As responsible
members of a digital society, it’s crucial for each of us to play a role
in combating these threats. By spreading awareness and educating ourselves
and others, we can reduce the chances of falling victim to such scams.
Additionally, we should protect ourselves by being cautious online, verifying
identities, and never believing offers or deals that seem too good to be
true. Together, we can create a safer digital environment for everyone.
Be alert in the cyberworld!</p>

<p><strong>Synopsis:</strong> The theme that we chose was “Be Safe”. Our target
audience is primary and secondary school students. So, we came up with
a gaming skit to entice them to watch. The skit is about a boy named Zack,
who loves playing games. One day, he receives a message in-game about an
attractive deal for something he wants. He gives his game account details
to a mysterious person. However, he soon receives an email telling him
that his game account had been blocked! In the end, he learns that if things
sound too good to be true, they probably are.</p>
<p>Thus, our message is: Beware of the dangers online! Be safe.</p>

<p><strong>Synopsis:</strong> Our video appeals to elderly or young adults
who are easily persuaded by scams online. Our video is for them to be educated
on situations like this and would hence also be able to impart this on
similar events. This video shows that just because it is cheap and affordable,
does not mean that it is true. Most people, often fall for these scams
and end up losing large amounts of their money. This means that, by giving
card information, without confirming and verifying that where they are
buying is an official website, they could be tricked and this results in
a devastating loss in their fortune.</p>

<p><strong>Synopsis:</strong> With cyberbullying becoming more rampant in
today’s world, it is vital for us to take on the role of an ‘upstander’,
putting a stop to cyberbullying by urging cyberbullies to think before
they post anything online. This video follows Gabrielle, who was faced
with harsh comments by a fellow classmate after posting selfies on Instagram,
Claudia. Saddened by Claudia’s words, Gabrielle was consoled by her friends
and was urged to report the incident to their teachers, Ms Kate and Ms
Evan, after knowing what has happened. Understanding the severity of cyberbullying,
the teachers spoke to Claudia about her wrongdoings and all was well as
Claudia apologised to Gabrielle. Targeted to cyberbullies who are unaware
of the consequences of their actions, this video also focuses on the potential
reasons behind the occurrence of cyberbullying and how seemingly simple
words can have a lasting impact on someone’s mental and physical health.</p>
