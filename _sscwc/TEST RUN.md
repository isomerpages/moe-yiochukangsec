### **Singapore Schools Cyber Wellness Challenge (SSCWC)** 
Is a national short film competition,
centred around Cyber Wellness themes, endorsed by the Infocomm Media Development Authority
(IMDA) and Media Literacy Council (MLC) in support of the Digital for Life (DfL) movement. 

### **"For Students, By Students"** 
The challenge seeks to promote youth advocacy and cultivate student leadership competencies, by integrating Peer Support and Relationships (PSR) into advocacy in Cyber Wellness education. Each participating team will comprise secondary school students playing the role of mentors to their primary school peers in the creation of media content illustrating the key messages of the DfL movement.

In order to generate meaningful media content that can impact and educate their peers and the
community, both primary and secondary school student participants will first explore and discuss Cyber Wellness issues, with guidance from TOUCH Cyber Wellness facilitators.

Student participants will then apply their learning to storyboard and conceptualise suitable stories /
messages in line with the selected key Cyber Wellness message and target audience. Student
participants will also be trained by learning specialists from Apple Singapore in the technical skills and knowledge for video production using the iPads.

SSCWC 2023 is organised by Yio Chu Kang Secondary School in partnership with TOUCH Cyber Wellness and Apple Singapore, supported by the South 1 School Cluster. // event logo and logos of various organisations
