<p>Synopsis: The theme that we chose was “Be Kind”. As our target audience
was primary school children, we decided to go with a gaming concept, to
make it more relatable to them. The video shows how children can prevent
themselves from becoming cyber bullies and spread kindness instead. Especially
since primary school children may not be mature enough to understand how
much their words could affect others, we hope the story will be applicable
to the children when they go on such gaming platforms.</p>

<p>Synopsis: Often times, the youth are tricked by malicious scammers due
to the lack of awareness of scams. Our video aims to broaden the knowledge
of primary school students on making smart choices to protect themselves
against scams. It features a boy who caused both him and his sister to
fall for the schemes of the scammers. Through this, we bring to light the
common methods used by scammers in hopes to bring our message across, “If
it’s too good to be true, it probably is.”</p>

<p>Synopsis: The video shows that you can’t trust anybody you see online
because anybody can pretend to be someone they are not on the internet.
In this video, it shows a teenage girl who befriends somebody she don’t
know online and plans to meet her after realising that they are in the
same school. The online friend she befriended was actually a stalker who
planned to kidnap her. The key message that we want to get across is to
be safe online and to not trust people online that we do not know.</p>
