Founded in 1965, the school was the 61st one established by a newly independent Singapore, and one of two built that year. The school was an answer to requests made personally to PM Lee Kuan Yew by farmers when he visited the rural community of Yio Chu Kang. The original building was sited at the 11th milestone / 16 km Yio Chu Kang Road.  
  
Officially opened by then Minister of Education Mr Ong Pang Boon, it started as an integrated English-Chinese stream school as part of government efforts to house two or more language streams under one administration and one principal. Thus, schools such as Yio Chu Kang Secondary School became a critical strategy in early nation building to emphasise the importance of bilingual education and to increase socialisation of students from different language mediums.  
  
Since then, the school has undergone **four campus transformations**, reflecting closely the growth and challenges of our nation, as well as the aspirations of her students and her community. The story of each campus revolution is a remarkable tale of the steadfast spirit of a school born of humble origins and the valiant efforts to survive and thrive in the face of enormous changes in Singapore’s education, economic and social landscape. In doing so, the school has remained true to her original ideals of Pursuit, Knowledge and Service.    
  
Today, the school continues to be an example of the national social and educational initiatives to meet emerging needs. In 2014, the school became the second Pathlight Satellite School, hosting students in an innovative commitment to create sustained and regular opportunities for authentic academic and social integration of students with different learning abilities. In 2018, the school merged with Chong Boon Secondary School. In many fundamental ways, the Merged School seeks to capture the school’s long story and half a century of DNA. It respects the long heritage and deep roots of both schools, while demonstrating through its remarkable story of how it is agile in change.
