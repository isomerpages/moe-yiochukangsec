Founded in 1965, the school was the 61st one established by a newly independent Singapore, and one of two built that year. The school was an answer to requests made personally to PM Lee Kuan Yew by farmers when he visited the rural community of Yio Chu Kang. The original building was sited at the 11th milestone / 16 km Yio Chu Kang Road.  
  
Officially opened by then Minister of Education Mr Ong Pang Boon, it started as an integrated English-Chinese stream school as part of government efforts to house two or more language streams under one administration and one principal. Thus, schools such as Yio Chu Kang Secondary School became a critical strategy in early nation building to emphasise the importance of bilingual education and to increase socialisation of students from different language mediums.  
  
Since then, the school has undergone **four campus transformations**, reflecting closely the growth and challenges of our nation, as well as the aspirations of her students and her community. The story of each campus revolution is a remarkable tale of the steadfast spirit of a school born of humble origins and the valiant efforts to survive and thrive in the face of enormous changes in Singapore’s education, economic and social landscape. In doing so, the school has remained true to her original ideals of Pursuit, Knowledge and Service.    
  
Today, the school continues to be an example of the national social and educational initiatives to meet emerging needs. In 2014, the school became the second Pathlight Satellite School, hosting students in an innovative commitment to create sustained and regular opportunities for authentic academic and social integration of students with different learning abilities. In 2018, the school merged with Chong Boon Secondary School. In many fundamental ways, the Merged School seeks to capture the school’s long story and half a century of DNA. It respects the long heritage and deep roots of both schools, while demonstrating through its remarkable story of how it is agile in change.

<p> In 2017, with the anticipated changes to the school as a Merged School, a growing Pathlight Satellite School, and to cater to more small group teaching, some classrooms were installed with partitions. Fortunately timed with the merger was the General Renovation and Repair (GR&R) Exercise at the end of 2017, during which the entire school was repainted with a fresh colour scheme and a new look was given to the school foyer and the staff cabinets outside the main staff room.<br>  
  
To echo the Merged School identity, a new school sign was erected at the main gate to display the name of the school in English and the adoption of Chong Boon’s Chinese name, 崇 文 中 学. Forty-Nine Solar Panels from Chong Boon, a legacy of her strong environmental education programme, were installed in Yio Chu Kang Secondary School.<br>  

To accommodate the larger staff and student strength due to the school merger, several changes were made to the existing infrastructure. This included a new staff room that was set up on level 3 to accommodate the English Department. To make room for more classes for teaching and learning, the Needlework room was converted into a normal classroom with flexible configuration. Several open spaces were converted into study hubs for student to gather after school hours. This gave students additional options to do self-study, hold consultations with teachers, or to hold discussions with schoolmates and collaborate informally on learning projects.<br>

As a satellite school for Pathlight School, 14 classrooms were converted progressively since 2014 for Pathlight students. In 2017, a new classroom block was constructed to provide YCKSians with additional classrooms and a covered void deck for student activities. The new block was opened for use on 2 Jan 2020 with the Secondary Four and Five students occupying it.<br>
