The symmetry of the logo symbolises the **balance of a holistic education for all**. It features three orange shapes that resemble the bloom of petals. Collectively, they represent the school’s desire to **nurture students who flourish as Competent Learners, Confident Leaders and Caring Innovators**.  
  
The **three segments** also suggest seeds beginning to burst open with energy and life, expressing optimism in growing people and nurturing aspirations. They reflect the belief that an open mind and a willingness to seek new experiences, ensures that students learn, thrive and make a difference. In this way the three seeds echo the key words of the school’s enduring motto of **Pursuit, Knowledge, and Service**.  
  
A strong **“Y”** in the centre not only stands for Yio Chu Kang Secondary School, but also suggests a tree trunk with branches pointing skyward in **open embrace of learning and service to others**.  
  
The **circle** that brings all the elements together forms a never ending ring to symbolise the **collaborative synergy of staff, students and the community** working together in a spirit of inclusivity.

<b>Interpretation (2006 – 2017)</b>  
  

*   The school logo features a circle containing a silhouette, in dark blue and white, of a tree with prominent roots and two birds flying in the sky. The circular shape symbolises the desire to nurture students to be gracious all-rounders. The flow of the horizon reflects the ease that students feel in embracing a holistic education.<br>   
    
*   The roots branch out in five directions symbolising the core values of Perseverance, Respect, Integrity, Dedication, and Excellence (PRIDE). The roots are the foundation for the tree to grow and flourish. The tree reaching towards the sky symbolises the students acquiring social and emotional competencies and maximising their potential in whatever they do.<br>   
    
*   The birds flying in the sky represent the creative and entrepreneurial spirit. They represent our students going beyond the school and its curriculum to venture into uncharted territories in their pursuit of lifelong learning.
