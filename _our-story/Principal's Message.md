Welcome to the Yio Chu Kang Secondary School website. To students and staff new to the school, welcome to the YCKSS Family!&nbsp;  
  
We are pleased to present an updated interface and hope that this new website will give greater access to information about the School. I would like to give due credit to the schoolâ€™s website development team which has worked tirelessly to make this fresh look possible. I encourage you to explore the website and discover how we create rich opportunities for our students to acquire a deeper understanding of their strengths and grow wider perspectives about our complex but wonderful world.
