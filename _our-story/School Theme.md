## **Future-Ready Begins Now**

The Future of Learning is here at Yio Chu Kang Secondary School!

With the relentless pace of technological advancement, we need to develop digital literacy and technological skills, and yet sharpen their uniquely human skills that cannot be replaced by technology.

We must be discerning, to be equipped to guard against being misled or manipulated by misinformation, and against the negative impact of technology on mental and social well-being. To thrive in multi-cultural, cross-disciplinary settings, we must be sensitive and balanced towards diverse perspectives; be resilient, innovative, and adaptable as we navigate disruptions and new frontiers.

At Yio Chu Kang, our practices and programmes are designed prepare us to be future-ready. With focused, deliberate, and pervasive infusion of enhanced 21st Century Competencies in our total curriculum, we have rich opportunities to create, connect and contribute in purposeful and meaningful ways.  

Because of the uncertainty present in the rapidly changing world today, we will need to manage complexity and ambiguity more than ever. We must learn to contextualise global issues and ground them in the Singapore context. There will be opportunities at Yio Chu Kang that enable us to attune to the needs of others and connect to the greater community where we belong.  

We hope that as one community of Yio Chu Kang, we develop our capacity to be curious, reflective, and persevering, driven by passion and purpose. While we hope to demonstrate courage and take risks responsibly, we also want to be empathetic when interacting with others.  

Let’s join hands and move into the exciting Future together! 

Future-Ready is Now!
