## **Empathy Creates Inclusivity**

Empathy is the highest form of emotional maturity. It is the ability to understand thoughts and feelings of other people in a given situation, from their point of view, rather than our own. This is not the same as sympathy, which is when one is moved by the feelings and thoughts of another person and yet remains emotional distanced. Empathy does not occur naturally for many people. In fact it is natural that we tend to judge first from our set of values and biases. However, like most skills, empathy can be learnt. With practice, empathy can become a natural character strength.

Empathy helps to establish and strengthen quality social connections. Research has found that having good social relationships is linked to health and wellness. It is strongly observed that emotional support is often made possible by empathy. This emotional support is an important protective factor in dealing with negative stress. It can help to reduce the risk of physical and mental health problems while bolstering our natural immunity. Therefore, empathy promotes wellness, builds stronger relationships, and reinforces mutual trust.

There are three components of empathy: cognitive, emotional and compassionate. Cognitive and emotional empathy combine to create genuine compassion. Educational research has found that an empathetic teacher nurtures a safe, caring and inclusive classroom environment that is conducive to learning. Such a teacher is effective in instilling the values and skills of learning across a diverse range of student profiles, setting them up for future success. Similarly, empathetic parents are able to cultivate confidence and role model social skills that enable their children to navigate in many types of social settings and form healthy peer relations.

If we invest in teaching our students how to develop empathy, we help them to create the conditions in their environment to exercise inclusive acceptance of peers with differing abilities and challenges. In this way, the 2023 YCKSS School Theme of **_Empathy Creates Inclusivity_** is a timely demonstration of the school’s collective commitment to the essential values and purpose of education, so as to strengthen our community and uplift individuals, regardless of uneven starting points in life.
