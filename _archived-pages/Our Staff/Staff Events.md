<p>&lt;h3&gt; Staff Appreciation Day 5th Sept&lt;/h3&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;The grouping for the bowling activity was done so that every
team had a mixed number of bowlers from school leaders to the EAS staff.
There was much bonding during the event. It was an event that favoured
no male or female bowlers. All 120 bowlers had an equal chance of doing
well for the team. At the end of the day, hidden talents in bowling emerged
and the rest had a very joyful day.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;h3&gt;Durian Feast&lt;/h3&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;At the durian feast held on 31st July 2019, our staff were spoiled
for choices. With a variety of fruits to choose from, the King of fruits
was definitely the favourite. Staff who tried the Mao Shan Wang (MSW) durian,
known to be the premium type, commented on its rich, bitter and heavily
rich flavour.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;It was indeed a great way to end the day and we had an enjoyable
bonding session over the feasting.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
