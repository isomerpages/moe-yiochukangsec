The Malay Dance CCA aims to instill the importance of self-discipline, confidence, perseverance and teamwork. Embracing the spirit of PERTAME\_NALURI SENI, we always strive to firstly touch our inner soul and enhance our feel through the dance. Our dancers are exposed to traditional and contemporary styles with movements showcasing the rich heritage of the genres portrayed. Our dancers are given opportunities to showcase their talent in various school and public performances. Performing at national events such as Youth Celebrate!, Chingay Parade and Muara Festival enable our the dancers to gain valuable experiences that develop them into better and more skillful dancers.
