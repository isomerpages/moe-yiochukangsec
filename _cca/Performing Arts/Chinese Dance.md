The Chinese Dance Club aims to engage the dancers in fun and interesting ways. We provide a platform for students to showcase their talents and creativity in Chinese dance through collaboration with external organisations. Through the various public performances, the club aims to progressively nurture the dancers to be young and confident adults. We have a comprehensive and structured programme to expose students to Chinese culture and learn the skills and techniques of Chinese Dance. Through dance, we also hope to instil self-discipline, perseverance and teamwork.
