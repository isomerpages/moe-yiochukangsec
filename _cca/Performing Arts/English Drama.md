In the English Drama Club, we teach students that drama is more than just acting, and every process in staging a production makes up the craft. Students will learn skills of devising, performance, stage management, prop marking, make-up and managing light and sound as well as an appreciation for arts and culture. The experiences gained, values learnt and friendship made will carry with the students even after graduation.
