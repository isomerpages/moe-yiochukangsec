TThe Indian Dance CCA aims to help develop and nurture the pupils holistically. Apart from exposure to Indian culture and different styles of Indian dance, the CCA also provides opportunities to the pupils to acquire self-confidence, determination, resilience, a sense of responsibility and the ability to work with others. With these qualities and disposition which align with the school values, we hope to equip them to succeed for life.
