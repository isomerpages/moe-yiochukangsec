The MARs (Mechatronics, Aeronautics and Robotics) Club was set up in January 2018 specifically to nurture a spirit of exploration and innovation where our students can channel their creative energies. We adopt the problem-based learning approach and students are provided with many opportunities to apply their knowledge into practical sessions. This is in-line with the focus on STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) curriculum. The MARs Club adopts this interdisciplinary and applied approach in their activities, creating a cohesive, authentic learning experience for our students.
