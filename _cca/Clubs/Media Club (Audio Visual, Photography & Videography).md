The Media Club aim to excite students about infocomm in a fun and meaningful way by helping them to learn new infocomm skills and to cultivate leadership capabilities.

### **Media Club - AV & Videography**

We offer students a hands-on experience in AV & Videography. Students learn to operate various professional equipment and tools and are encouraged to explore and exercise their creativity. They are given opportunities to stretch their imagination and tell compelling stories through video-making. We have a comprehensive programme to build their foundation in the artistic and technical aspects of Videography. To create an authentic experience, students are involved in planning and executing the media coverage of large scale school events such as our school's Speech Day, MOE Singapore-Hong Kong School Exchange, N6 Cluster Media and Design Festival.

### **Media Club - Photography**

Our photography programme offers students structured training that equips them with technical knowledge and skills in photography. Students are given opportunities to exercise their artistic talent to capture photos based on specific themes, guided by our experience instructor. The team also serves the school events.
