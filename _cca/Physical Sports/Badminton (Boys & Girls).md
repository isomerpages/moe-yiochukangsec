The Badminton CCA aims to equip students with the fundamentals of the sport as well as develop positive self-esteem and sportsmanship. Through participation in competitions, students will learn the values of respect, self-discipline, honesty and teamwork. Badminton is a fast-paced racket sport that involves intense mental concentration and an ability to anticipate and pre-empt the opponent's moves is essential. It also requires determination, perseverance and discipline in players to master the different skills. Our players train together with a common set of beliefs as they strive to bring YCKSS Badminton to greater heights.
