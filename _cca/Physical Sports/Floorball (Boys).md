<p>The Floorball CCA aims to foster strong bonds among team members and a competitive spirit. It teaches our students the fundamentals of the sport and also inculcates the values and belinoteefs behind the nature of the sport. Floorball is a fast paced sport encompassing skilful manoeuvres and athletic endurance. It requires determination and discipline in players to master their individual skills. As a team, we train together with commitment and enthusiasm to bring YCKSS Floorball to greater heights.</p>
