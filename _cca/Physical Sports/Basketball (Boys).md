The Basketball CCA aims to develop qualities such as positive self-esteem and sportsmanship through their participation in training sessions and competition. We seek to inculcate values of gratitude, respect for others, honesty and teamwork. Basketball as a sport plays an important role in the physical, cognitive, social, emotional and character development of every student. Students learn skills of self-management, responsible decision-making and social awareness. The broad philosophy of our approach is to ensure that every student who has the potential, ability or interest is provided with the opportunity to develop his potential to the fullest.
