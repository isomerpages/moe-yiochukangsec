The Service Learning through Issue Investigation programme develops an inclusive student who **cares** and **takes action** to make a difference to the community. Service Learning is a platform that allows the Social Studies Issue Investigation project to take on a real world application. Through this project, students gain an experience on how to make a difference to the community and to address the issue which they have identified.   

  
**Objectives of the programme**  

*   To develop an inclusive student who **cares** and **takes action** to make a difference to the community. 
*   To provide **opportunities** for students to address the societal issue which they have identified.
*   To nurture students that demonstrate the **school values**, namely Gratitude, Respect, Optimism, Wholeheartedness, Teamwork and Honesty.   
    

  
**Key Programmes**   

This project involves all Secondary Three students across the three courses. Using the skills in data collection and interpretation that are integral in Social Studies Issue Investigation, teams select an issue that they would like to investigate and address. To allow students to have a voice and choice, they are given four comprehensive areas of societal issues to investigate on and impact. They are:

  

> 1) Environmental and Animal Welfare  
> 2) Cyber Wellness and Literacy  
> 3) Mental and Physical Wellness
> 4) Social Inclusivity and Awareness

  

They will then proceed to gather data and evaluate what are the crucial needs of the selected sector in community. Working with an external organisation, the teams embark on a project to address the need that was identified.
