The Learning for Life Programme at YCKSS aims to give all students an enriching experience and to foster excellence in the creative arts through&nbsp;**Arts, Media and Design (AMD) Programme.**&nbsp;This programme not only raises the level of arts appreciation and knowledge, it develops character as students persevere to learn new skills and work in teams with fellow peers. It also provides an avenue for self-expression, character building and the development of important social-emotional skills to thrive beyond the secondary school years.  

  
**Objectives of the programme**&nbsp;  

Our AMD Programme aims to:&nbsp;

1.  progressively expose students to a variety of art forms, media and design as well as to provide an in-depth experience in the learning of art as they advance;&nbsp;  
    
2.  encourage values and character development by purposefully planning for relevant curriculum; stretch the potential of talented students by providing students opportunities to hone their talents and skills through partnerships with Institutes of Higher Learning, external organisations and pathfinders.

**Key Programmes**&nbsp;  
**The AMD Programme**&nbsp;The AMD Programme is a structured and progressive two-year programme.&nbsp;

*   **Secondary One**&nbsp;Students embark on a foundation programme in Secondary One where they are exposed to five different modules in Arts (Modern Dance, Drama, Music - Rock and &amp; Pop), Media (Short Film Production) and Design (Interior Design). At the end of each module, students will reflect on their journey studying the module and how they have overcome any challenges in the course learning a new skill.&nbsp;

  

*   **Secondary Two**&nbsp;&nbsp;In Secondary Two, depending on their interests, they will specialise in one module. Students attend their chosen modules weekly during curriculum time throughout the planned academic year. At the end of the year, the Secondary Two students will showcase their talents and what they have learnt through AMD Showcase at the year-end assembly.

Talent Development Programme  

  

In Secondary Two and Three, students who are keen can further hone their talents and skills through our Talent Development Programmes via interest groups, master classes, enrichment and relevant Advanced Elective Modules.

**Direct School Admission (DSA)**  

  

Successful DSA applicants through AMD are expected to enrol in the relevant performing arts and media-related CCAs to help develop their talents progressively. The students will be involved in performances, workshops with arts practitioners and competitions in order to gain greater exposure and hone their skills. They also attend a variety of external performances so as to develop their critical understanding of the art form.
