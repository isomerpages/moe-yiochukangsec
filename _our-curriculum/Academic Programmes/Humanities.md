**Vision** 

Every YCKSian a concerned citizen with a lens to the world 

  

****Mission**** 

To develop informed learners and concerned citizens through mastery of analytical skills and exposure to global issues. 

  

****Key Programmes**** 

Using the inquiry approach, students get to investigate issue and appreciate knowledge beyond the classrooms. 

  

****Geographical Investigation**** 

Students investigate the interactions between people and their physical and human environment. Students extend their learning in different places in Singapore such as Sungei Buloh Nature Reserve and Orchard Road where they explore key geographical concepts and collect data to support their field investigations. 

  

****Historical Investigation**** 

Students are given the opportunity to acquire historical knowledge as they examine varied forms of primary and secondary sources. A trip to the National Museum of Singapore allows students to come face-to-face with real artefacts which help form their understanding of Singapore’s history. 

  

****Issue Investigation**** 

In collaboration with the CCE department, Secondary Three students explore various societal issues during Social Studies lessons and they get to do their part to contribute to the good of the society as they plan and execute their Service Learning projects to address the issue.

**Learning through Play**   

The department specially designed and created card games to help students understand and recall key geographical knowledge and concepts in a fun way.
