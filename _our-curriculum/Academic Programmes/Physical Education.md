## **Key Programmes**
### **Physical Education Programmes**



### Sports Education Modules

Sports and games are integral part of a student’s life. Students should play sports and games to enjoy the health and vigour of life. Games and sports help to shape character, build a sense of cooperation and team-spirit in an individual and also recognise the collective efforts of all the members of the team.&nbsp;  

The students in each level will learn about two games each year. Games related concepts such as the use of space, maintaining possession, creating attack, organising defence, and defending space and running to bases are consciously weaved into the lessons with an emphasis on the learning and demonstration of values like integrity, respect and sportsmanship.
