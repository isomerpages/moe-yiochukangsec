## **Key Programmes**
### **Physical Education Programmes**



### Sports Education Modules

Sports and games are integral part of a student’s life. Students should play sports and games to enjoy the health and vigour of life. Games and sports help to shape character, build a sense of cooperation and team-spirit in an individual and also recognise the collective efforts of all the members of the team.&nbsp;  

The students in each level will learn about two games each year. Games related concepts such as the use of space, maintaining possession, creating attack, organising defence, and defending space and running to bases are consciously weaved into the lessons with an emphasis on the learning and demonstration of values like integrity, respect and sportsmanship.

### Outdoor Education Modules

Sec 3 MOE-OBS Camp Secondary Three students will participate in the MOE-OBS Camp. The programme seeks to provide students from different schools the opportunities to work together and overcome various challenges through outdoor adventure learning. They also create opportunities for students to develop Social Emotional Competencies of Self-Awareness, Self-Management, Social Awareness, Relationship Management and Responsible Decision making through various team-building activities.

### Sports Participation Programme

A wide array of sporting activities ranging from Parachute Volleyball, Captain Hoopball, Street Basketball, Water Soccer, Bubble Soccer, Tag Archery, Inline Skating, mass Hip Hop dance, etc will be organised.
