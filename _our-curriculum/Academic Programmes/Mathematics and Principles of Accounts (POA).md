### **Key Programmes**&nbsp;

  

#### Authentic Learning in Mathematics&nbsp;

  

Our department believes in offering innovative approaches to help our students grow more confident in problem solving. This is done through several interesting activities which help students see the relevance of what they learn:&nbsp;

*   Sec 2 Express students are taught data handling skills through the use of open source sensors installed around the school.  
    
*   Sec 1 â€“ 3 students are given Math Modelling Tasks to simulate the solving of Real World Problems.  
    
*   Our Math Curriculum challenges students to solve authentic problems through the Real World Context (PRWC) questions.  
    



#### **Financial Literacy Programme**



  

*   This exciting programme helps upper secondary students create an awareness of the importance of financial planning by providing them a head start in learning abstract concepts on financial literacy using an experiential game.&nbsp;  
    

#### **Algebra Games**

*   **_The Smart City Explorer_**&nbsp;is the invention of our teachers who have designed it to create joy in learning algebraic concepts in the lower secondary mathematics classroom through play. Using this games based approach, students learn in teams and become more competent and confident about their abilities in algebraic manipulations.
