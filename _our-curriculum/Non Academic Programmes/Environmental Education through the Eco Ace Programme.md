<p> <i>A community of innovators who creates sustainable ideas and green initiatives.</i><br>

As a community of innovators, the school created and installed its own rainwater harvesting system. The rainwater collected in these tanks is used to water the green scape and for general cleaning of the school.<br>

The school also has 59 solar panels that are grid-tied to a utilities company. These panels generate a significant amount of solar energy for the school. Additional solar panels, which were installed within the sight of students, serve as an authentic learning resource for students to engage in multi-disciplinary discussions.<br>

With their creativity, students have participated in external competitions and programmes to show their commitment towards environment conservation.<br>

<p> In line with 21st century competencies and CCE2021, there is a larger educational call to nurture students who are able to exercise sound and discerning decision-making as they grow into concerned and responsible citizens. There is potential to develop students’ deeper appreciation for, and to motivate them into committed actions towards realising that their personal and collective lifestyle choices do have an impact on the environment.<br><br>

<b>Multi-disciplinary Eco Project</b><br>

The Multi-disciplinary Eco Project is an integrated learning experience that encourages students to break away from compartmentalising the different subject disciplines. It provides opportunities for students to explore the&nbsp;<b>interconnections between subjects</b>&nbsp;such as Humanities, Science and Mathematics.<br>&nbsp;

The integrated curriculum provides&nbsp;<b>authentic problem solving experiences</b>&nbsp;with application to real-world situations, tapping on Problem-Based Learning approach and incorporate&nbsp;<b>RICE Thinking Skills</b>&nbsp;of Reflective, Inventive, Critical and Empathetic Thinking.<br>&nbsp;

The Eco Project capitalises on&nbsp;<b>technology and innovations</b>&nbsp;in STEM to find viable responses to sustainability-friendly solutions and innovations. The addition of the six roof-mounted solar panels allow students to view them within their sight. The supporting system allows students to collect data on the amount of energy generated by the solar panels. The system is complemented with temperature, light intensity and humidity sensors to allow students to identify patterns between weather conditions and amount of energy harnessed by the solar panels.<br><br>
