<h4><strong>Purchase of PLD</strong></h4>
<p>
<br>Singapore Citizen students can use their available&nbsp;Edusave balance&nbsp;to
pay for the PLD after setting aside provision for payment of miscellaneous
fees.</p>
<p>
<br>To ensure the affordability of devices, MOE has provided Edusave top-ups
of $200 in 2020 to 2022, and $300 in 2023, to all eligible Singaporean
students in primary and secondary schools. This is on top of the annual
Edusave contribution of $290 for secondary students and $230 for primary
students.</p>
<p>
<br><strong>Subsidies</strong>&nbsp;are available for students who require
financial assistance to purchase a PLD.</p>
<p>
<br>Please note that it is compulsory for all existing students on the MOE
Financial Assistance Scheme to use their Edusave to pay for the PLD, after
subsidies have been granted.</p>
<p>
<br>Students under the MOE Financial Assistance&nbsp; (FAS) &nbsp;Scheme for
the year will automatically be subsidised for the PLD.</p>
<p>
<br>Students who are currently not under the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme
may apply for additional subsidy if their&nbsp;<strong>Gross Household Income (GHI)</strong>&nbsp;is
$4,000 or less, or&nbsp;<strong>Per Capita Income (PCI)</strong>&nbsp;is
$1,000 or less.Please collect the application form at the General Office.</p>
<p><strong><em>“PCI”</em></strong><em> refers to the Gross Household Income divided by the total number of family members in the household.</em>
</p>
<hr>
<h4><strong>Responsible Use of the PLD</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p>To support the use of the PLD in the classroom, as well as safeguard students’
cyber wellness, the PLD will be pre-installed with a Device Management
Application (DMA).
<br>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The school has in place measures to enable a safe and seamless learning
environment for students.</p>

<p>The role of the parent is also key in partnering the school to support
your child.&nbsp;Parents could refer to the school's&nbsp;<strong>Digital Wellness Policy (DWP)</strong>&nbsp;when
helping to manage your child’s use of digital devices and platforms. The
policy will help your child to understand digital wellness matters and
to enable a conducive learning environment. The DWP can be found in the

</a>
</p>
<p>
<br>The&nbsp;<strong>Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)</strong>&nbsp;sets out the
rules and regulations that govern the use of PLD by students. This policy
will serve to ensure the safe and secure use of the device, and facilitate
effective learning with technology. The AUP can be found in the&nbsp;
