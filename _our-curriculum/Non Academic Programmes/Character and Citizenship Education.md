<p><strong>Department Vision</strong>
<br>Every YCKsian is grounded in sound values to serve the nation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Department Mission</strong>
<br>To instil in all students the school's core values embodied in the word
GROWTH
<br>Gratitude
<br>Respect
<br>Optimism
<br>Wholeheartedness
<br>Teamwork
<br>Honesty</p>
<p>The goal of Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is to inculcate
values and build competencies in our students to help them grow to be good
individuals and useful citizens. In Yio Chu Kang Secondary School, every
teacher is a CCE teacher who engages the students to develop knowledge,
skills and attitude to make informed and responsible choices in their lives.
This is done through CCE lessons where our teachers facilitate students’
learning for building positive character and citizenry according to the
following themes.</p>
<p>• The Leader Within
<br>• Family Our Foundation
<br>• Being a Positive Influence
<br>• Thinking Hearts, Feeling Minds
<br>• U &amp; I in the Community
<br>• This is Home Truly
<br>• The World in Singapore</p>
<p>To develop social and emotional competencies in students, the following
programmes are incorporated into CCE lessons:</p>
<p>• Cyber Wellness&nbsp;
<br>• Education and Career Guidance&nbsp;
<br>• Sexuality Education&nbsp;
<br>• Values in Action&nbsp;</p>
<p>CCE lessons are also a platform to deliver the National Education (NE)
experience. [link to NE webpage]</p>

<h4>Education Career Guidance&nbsp;(ECG)</h4>
<p>Education and Career Guidance (ECG) is about engaging, inspiring and challenging
students to develop aspirations and plan proactively for their future.
The acquisition of knowledge about self and opportunities in education
and work will enable students to apply decision-making skills and develop
plans to achieve their career aspirations and life goals. Through ECG,
social emotional competencies such as proactivity, adaptability and resilience
are developed to prepare students for the 21st Century workforce.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Through the ECG Curriculum, we aim to:
<br>
</p>
<p>• deepen students’ understanding of self and relate schooling to the different
education and career pathways
<br>• enable students to synthesise information gathered from relevant sources
to make sound educational and career decisions</p>
<p>At Yio Chu Kang Secondary School, the ECG curriculum is delivered through
the following three modes:
<br>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>ECG Curriculum</strong>
<br>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>•&nbsp;Structured ECG Lessons
<br>Time in the curriculum is put aside to introduce students to information
about careers and future education options.&nbsp; We encourage students
to take ownership of their own learning and development, and understand
the importance of continued learning as they progress beyond secondary
school years.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>•&nbsp;MySkillsFuture portal
<br>This is an online portal that facilitates education and career development
among students. Students are introduced to this tool to help them uncover
their attributes,find out more about different careers that they might
be interested in and chart their educational pathways to achieve their
aspirations. Students will have guided lessons on how to use this portal
and it can be accessed from home.

<h4><strong>National Education (NE)</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p>National Education is experienced through the 4 key NE celebrations that
are run throughout the year. Total Defence Day, International Friendship
Day, Racial Harmony Day and National Day.
<br>
</p>
<p>Through a variety of activities ranging from learning packages to cultural
displays and parades, students immerse themselves in the uniqueness that
is Singapore.
<br>
<br>The NE Unit also seeks for opportunities to work with partners to enhance
the celebrations. Partners we have worked with include Parents and the
International Students Integration Programme group.

<h4><strong>Sexuality Education (SEd)</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Moe Sexuality Education in Schools</strong>
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools
aims to enable students to understand the physiological, social and emotional
changes they experience as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships
with others, including those with members of the opposite sex, and make
wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters. SEd is premised
on the importance of the family as the basic unit of society. This means
encouraging healthy, heterosexual marriages and stable nuclear family units
with extended family support. The teaching and learning of SEd is based
on respect for the values and beliefs of the different ethnic and religious
communities in Singapore on sexuality issues.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <strong>Goals</strong> of Sexuality
Education are to:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Support
students in managing their physiological, social and emotional changes
as they grow up and develop safe and healthy relationships.</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guide
students to make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality
matters.</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Help students
develop a moral compass and respect for themselves and others by having
positive mainstream values and attitudes about sexuality that are premised
on the family as the basic unit of society.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <strong>Key Messages</strong> of
Sexuality Education are:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love and
respect yourself as you love and respect others;</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Build
positive relationships based on love and respect (which are the foundation
for strong families);</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make responsible
decisions for yourself, your family and society; and</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Abstinence
before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV and unintended
pregnancies. Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your loved ones.</p>

<p><strong>Overview of Yio Chu Kang Secondary School’s Sexuality Education Programme for 2025</strong>
</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sexuality Education is delivered
in a holistic manner through the school curriculum. The content for Sexuality
Education is grouped into five main themes: Human Development, Interpersonal
Relationships, Sexual Health, Sexual Behaviour, and, Culture, Society and
Law. You may click <a href="https://go.gov.sg/moe-sexuality-education-scope" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> for more
information on the scope of Sexuality Education in the school curriculum.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The subjects that incorporate topics
on sexuality include:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Science</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)</p>
<p><strong><u>Sexuality Education Lessons</u></strong>:</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The values and attitudes of our
youth towards sexuality are increasingly shaped by their peers, exposure
to the media, popular culture and the internet. Adolescence is a complex
stage in life as the adolescent attempts to find his or her own identity
and often struggles with new social relationships. The period of middle
adolescence (generally from 15 – 17 years old) can be a turbulent period
for adolescents. The gap between physical and emotional/cognitive maturity
may result in a tendency to act on impulse, experiment with various activities
(including sexual activities), sometimes without understanding the unpleasant
consequences that may arise from such experimentation. The need for peer
acceptance can be overwhelmingly strong and hinder one’s ability to act
responsibly.&nbsp; Given the pressures faced by the middle adolescent from
within themselves and from peers, it is important to build a strong sense
of self-worth, personal conviction and an understanding of the possible
consequences of sexual behaviour.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the Sexuality Education
lessons, secondary students will have the opportunity to develop a positive
self-esteem, develop their character, and expand their understanding and
repertoire of skills to deal with various issues related to sexuality,
which are of prime concern at this age.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;<em><u>eTeens</u></em><u> Programme</u></strong>:</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>eTeens</em> is a programme developed
by Health Promotion Board, in collaboration with the Ministry of Education,
to provide Secondary 3 students with accurate information on STIs, HIV
and protection from a health perspective. <em>eTeens</em> is conducted in
two segments – a mass talk segment and a classroom-based programme. The
desired outcome of the <em>eTeens</em> programme is that students are empowered
to make wise, informed and sensible decisions.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students are taught skills such
as decision-making, assertiveness and negotiation to say “no” to sex and
negative peer pressure. They also learn that the impact of STIs/HIV extends
beyond themselves and involves their family, and the importance of responsible
decision-making and seeking help. Abstinence and upholding family values
are the key messages.</p>
<p><strong>At Yio Chu Kang Secondary School, the <em>eTeens</em> programme will be implemented as follows in 2025:</strong>
