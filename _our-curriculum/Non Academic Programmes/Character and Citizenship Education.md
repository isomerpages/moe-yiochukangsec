The goal of Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is to inculcate values and build competencies in our students to help them grow to be good individuals and useful citizens. In Yio Chu Kang Secondary School, every teacher is a CCE teacher who engages the students to develop knowledge, skills and attitude to make informed and responsible choices in their lives. This is done through CCE lessons where our teachers facilitate students’ learning for building positive character and citizenry according to the following themes.  

> • The Leader Within  
> • Family Our Foundation  
> • Being a Positive Influence  
> • Thinking Hearts, Feeling Minds  
> • U & I in the Community  
> • This is Home Truly  
> • The World in Singapore

  
To develop social and emotional competencies in students, the following programmes are incorporated into CCE lessons:  

> • Cyber Wellness   
> • Education and Career Guidance   
> • Sexuality Education   
> • Values in Action 

  
CCE lessons are also a platform to deliver the National Education (NE) experience. \[link to NE webpage\]

<p>   
Education and Career Guidance (ECG) is about engaging, inspiring and challenging students to develop aspirations and plan proactively for their future. The acquisition of knowledge about self and opportunities in education and work will enable students to apply decision-making skills and develop plans to achieve their career aspirations and life goals. Through ECG, social emotional competencies such as proactivity, adaptability and resilience are developed to prepare students for the 21st Century workforce.  
  
Through the ECG Curriculum, we aim to:  

> • deepen students’ understanding of self and relate schooling to the different education and career pathways  
> • enable students to synthesise information gathered from relevant sources to make sound educational and career decisions

  
At Yio Chu Kang Secondary School, the ECG curriculum is delivered through the following three modes:  
  
1. **ECG Curriculum**  
  

*   Structured ECG Lessons  
    Time in the curriculum is put aside to introduce students to information about careers and future education options.  We encourage students to take ownership of their own learning and development, and understand the importance of continued learning as they progress beyond secondary school years.

*   MySkillsFuture portal  
    This is an online portal that facilitates education and career development among students. Students are introduced to this tool to help them uncover their attributes,find out more about different careers that they might be interested in and chart their educational pathways to achieve their aspirations. Students will have guided lessons on how to use this portal and it can be accessed from home.

2. **ECG Experience**  
  
To make the learning real and to equip students with a better understanding of the multiple pathways to success, students go through the following ECG experiences. </p>
