**Developing the Leadership Capacity of our Students**  
In Yio Chu Kang Secondary School, we seek to nurture each student’s potential by providing them with ample opportunities to anticipate, act and reflect upon their learning through a variety of leadership platforms within and beyond the school context.  We adopt a progressive school-wide approach to student leadership development.

i.    Secondary One students learn about **self-leadership** through their level camp which seeks to help them affirm their strengths, needs and values, and to also apply the skills they learnt to facilitate a smoother transition from primary to secondary school.  
  
ii.    Secondary Two students learn about **peer leadership** through their level camp, where they are taught to appreciate diversity through working with others.  This would also help students to foster a better understanding of their peers, sharpening their teamwork, inter-personal skills, and social awareness.   
  
iii.    Secondary Three students have the opportunity to exercise **peer- and community leadership** through their Service Learning through Issues Investigation project. This requires students to conceptualise, plan and execute a project that can serve the needs of others within the community.

iv.    Our alumni continue to contribute to the school even after graduation. They are grateful for the various opportunities given to them during their schooling days in Yio Chu Kang Secondary School and hence **pay it forward by giving back to the school**. They mentor their juniors and share valuable knowledge to help others in their CCAs, or in the various Student Leadership groups. Some alumni have also been invited to share their experiences through school-wide talks.

  

At all levels, students continue to have opportunities to take on informal leadership roles through projects or school events. We firmly believe that all students can be a leader as they demonstrate self-leadership through positive role-modelling.
