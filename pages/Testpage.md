<h3><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Lower Secondary Science SPA</strong></h4>
<p>In Lower Secondary Science SPA, students are taught Science Practical
Skills of Performing, Observing and Planning over a period of two years.
Skills-based assessments which address the different kinds of laboratory
skills in practical work will be embedded to complement the learning cycle.
Assessment for learning and assessment as learning will be scheduled during
the whole learning cycle.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Mendel’s Garden (Lower Secondary Science)</strong></h4>
<p>“Mendel’s Garden” is an instructional programme inspired by a working
life-size experimental greenhouse which demonstrates the applications of
vertical urban farming. It is named after the Father of Genetics, Gregor
Mendel, who discovered the fundamental laws of inheritance through his
work on pea plants grown in his own garden.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This discovery in one’s own garden provided the impetus for the school
to create its own Mendel’s Garden to provide opportunities for students
to learn beyond the classroom through hands-on experimentation and collaborative
problem-solving. Mendel’s Garden features a vertical growing system that
uses sophisticated technology to overcome the challenges of growing crops
in limited spaces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this garden, lower secondary science students see Science comes alive
in the following focus areas.</p>

importance of finding innovative solutions to grow food in land-scarce
Singapore as observed in the urban farming movement.</p>

<h4><strong>Da Vinci Programme (Secondary 2 – 4)</strong></h4>
<p>The Da Vinci Programme is a progressive Science Talent Development Programme
that complements the Science department’s core curriculum in developing
the scientific minds of our students. The objective of the Da Vinci Programme
is to enable selected students who demonstrated an attitude and aptitude
for scientific research to participate in research projects under the guidance
of teacher mentors from different Science disciplines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The students work on research projects under the close mentorship of teacher
mentors throughout a two-year programme spanning between Secondary 2 and
3. They will identify problems and attempt to use scientific solutions
to investigate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students’ research will culminate in a project presentation at:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Unity Scientific Innovation Challenge (USIC)</strong> – Secondary
2;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>North Zone Elementz Science Research Conference and Exhibition</strong> –
Secondary 3; and the participation in the</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>C B Paul Science Quiz</strong> by ACJC, NTU and NUS, which provides
a platform for students to network with other like-minded students and
budding scientists in Singapore. – Secondary 4&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Healthcare Mentorship programme (Secondary 3)</strong></h4>
<p>The Healthcare Mentorship programme seeks to expose our Secondary 3 Biology
students to the real healthcare environment where they experience first-hand
and learn how the knowledge and skills they acquired in school can be applied
to the work environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This programme aims to help our students better understand the challenges
our healthcare workers face in their work, the importance of giving back
to the society, and inspire them to possibly seek out a career in the healthcare
sector.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Throughout this journey, I learnt that with hard work and teamwork, the
output will be fruitful. I felt that my teammates and I supported each
other well. One example was the presentation in front of a panel of judges.
My teammates' confidence boosted my morale and helped me deliver my lines
effectively. Without their support, I never would have been able to overcome
my nervousness.”</p>
<p><strong>Kim Seulkichan, 4E1</strong>

<blockquote>
<p>“The entirety of Elementz was filled with fun. I was able to further bond
with my classmates as we came up with the hypothesis for the project and
executed it. I was glad to be part of my Elementz team and we even brought
back a Silver medal! All in all, I felt that Elementz has allowed me to
apply the concepts that I learnt in Biology to solve problems, other than
the usual class work. Given the chance, I would definitely sign up for
a research project again."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The healthcare mentorship programme has been very fruitful and it has
inspired me to work in the healthcare industry and contribute to society.
I felt it was a once-in-a-lifetime experience for a 15-year-old like me
to be part of this extraordinary programme. It has encouraged me to study
harder for Biology. I hope future participants can reap as many benefits
as I had from the experiences.”</p>
