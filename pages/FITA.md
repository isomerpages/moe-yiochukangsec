description: From Ideas To Action (F.I.T.A.) is an innovative multidisciplinary
  STEM programme that empowers students to tackle real-world challenges by
  integrating knowledge from Humanities, Design & Technology, Mathematics, and
  Science. Through inquiry-based learning and Design Thinking, students apply
  RICE (Reflective, Inventive, Critical, Empathetic) Thinking Skills to develop
  thoughtful, practical solutions. By working collaboratively on authentic
  performance tasks, they deepen their understanding of environmental and
  societal issues while enhancing critical thinking and empathy. F.I.T.A.
  nurtures curiosity, creativity, and cross-disciplinary thinking — shaping
  tomorrow’s problem-solvers and changemakers through meaningful, hands-on
  learning experiences.
