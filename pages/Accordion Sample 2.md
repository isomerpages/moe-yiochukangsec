<p>Yio Chu Kang Secondary School was invited to perform in 2023 National Day Parade (NDP) Act 4 – Onward as One with Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Secondary School, CHIJ St Theresa’s Convent and Nanyang Girls’ High School.

        <p> Participating in the National Day Parade (NDP) as a school was an unforgettable and pride-filled experience. The atmosphere was electrifying as students from various schools came together, adorned in the red-white costume for on 9 August. As the students danced in unison to the NDP 23 Theme song, “Shine Your Light”, they signified the light that would lead us ahead into the future. The camaraderie and sense of unity among schools created a powerful sense of national identity and belonging.</p>
