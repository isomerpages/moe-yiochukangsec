# STAFF WELL-BEING COMMITTEE (SWC) ACTIVITIES

The Staff Well-being Committee (SWC) adopts the PIES approach, looking into the physical, intellectual, emotional and social well-being pf the staff. The school aims to develop an engaged staff who care for self and others. Some of the plans in promoting staff well-being and satisfaction include identifying staff needs, staff well-being programmes and activities and providing a safe and secure environment.

	<h3>Mini Durian Delights</h3>

<p>The air buzzed with anticipation when a hint of its presence was dropped through a text message. Upon its arrival, the atmosphere intensified; some rushed up to it with their like-minded colleagues, while others scrunched up their noses yet politely declined, saying, ‘I would give it a miss.’ It is none other than the king of fruits – durian!</p>

<p>On the 28th of June 2024, staff were greeted by the strong and distinct aroma of durians. Enthusiasts revelled in its rich and creamy texture, especially in the company of other durian lovers at the Heritage Gallery. Whether the unique aroma elicited adoration or aversion, everyone had either the king of fruits or other delectable fruits to savour that day. While durians may reign supreme in the hearts of many fruit lovers, they did not overshadow the significance of the shared experience among us in the teaching fraternity.</p>

<h3>Embracing the Spirit of Hari Raya</h3>


<p>Hari Raya festivities are synonymous with an exquisite array of culinary delights. It was no exception this year, with the primary aim of fostering YCKSS familial ties. On 19 April, as the aroma of tantalising lunch filled the air, it set the perfect backdrop for colleagues to engage in hearty conversations amidst their busy lives.</p>

<p>Gathered in the cozy comfort of the Dance Studio 2, we revelled in the light-hearted stories steeped in history and practices of Muslims. While it culminated in quizzes that challenged our knowledge and wit, the winners brought home some mementos that served as vivid reminders of the generosity and inclusivity embedded within the Muslim culture.</p>

    <p>At the durian feast held on 31st July 2019, our staff were spoiled for choices. With a variety of fruits to choose from, the King of fruits was definitely the favourite. Staff who tried the Mao Shan Wang (MSW) durian, known to be the premium type, commented on its rich, bitter and heavily rich flavour.
     </p><p>It was indeed a great way to end the day and we had an enjoyable bonding session over the feasting.</p>
