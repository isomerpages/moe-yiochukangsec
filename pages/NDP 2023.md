<p>Yio Chu Kang Secondary School was invited to perform in 2023 National Day Parade (NDP) Act 4 – Onward as One with Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Secondary School, CHIJ St Theresa’s Convent and Nanyang Girls’ High School. The school is thankful for the opportunity given as it is a highly anticipated event that fosters a strong sense of belonging and unity among students and staff. </p>

<p>Leading up to NDP, students engaged in a series of activities, from intense weekly training sessions in school, and Saturdays’ morning rehearsals and evening vibrant performances at the Padang to learning journey at campsite and bonding sessions with participants of the other 3 schools. </p>

<p>Participating in the National Day Parade (NDP) as a school was an unforgettable and pride-filled experience. The atmosphere was electric as students from various schools came together, adorned in the red-white costume for Act 4 on 9 August. The synchronized performances and meticulously coordinated routines showcased the immense dedication and hard work put in by both students and teachers, reflecting our collective commitment to celebrating the spirit of our nation. As the students danced in unison to the NDP 23 Theme song, “Shine Your Light”, they signified the light that would lead us ahead into the future. The camaraderie and sense of unity among schools created a powerful sense of national identity and belonging.</p>
