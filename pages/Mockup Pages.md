<section>
        <p>
            <strong>Yio Chu Kang Secondary Schoolâ€™s National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) CCA</strong> 
            is committed to nurturing selfless individuals who contribute to the safety and security of the community. 
            Through engaging activities and meaningful experiences, our cadets develop strong character, leadership, and resilience, 
            equipping them to excel as caring and responsible citizens. 
					</p><p>NPCC instills core values such as discipline, loyalty, 
            integrity, resourcefulness, tenacity, and civic consciousness, fostering a sense of responsibility and pride. 
            Cadets gain unique insights into the Singapore Police Force (SPF) through interactions with officers at Neighbourhood 
            Police Centres and visits to various police establishments. To broaden their knowledge and skills, cadets participate 
            in specialized courses, including Anti-Drug Abuse, Basic Law, Crime Prevention, Crime Scene Investigation, First Aid, 
						Police Procedures, and SG Secure. </p>
            <p><strong>These experiences enrich their learning journey, shaping them into capable and community-conscious individuals.</strong>
