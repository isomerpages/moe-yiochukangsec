                    <h3>Bringing Creativity to Life</h3>
                    <p>Yio Chu Kang Secondary School's Digital Animation Club CCA enables students to dive into the exciting world of 2D animation, using programs such as CrazyTalk Animator, Flipaclip, CapCut, and Keynote on their iPads. They learn both the technical and creative aspects of animation, developing the skills needed to create their own animated films. Our structured programme equips students with foundational knowledge and experience to prepare them for infocomm-related courses in Institutes of Higher Learning.</p>
                    <p>Members have the opportunity to participate in prestigious competitions, including N.E.mation! and other animation challenges, showcasing their talent and creativity. Students work collaboratively to produce short animated video clips featuring dynamic 2D characters and creations. Final editing is completed using Adobe Premiere Pro and CapCut, culminating in polished, professional projects. Throughout their animation journey, students cultivate important values like teamwork, perseverance, and gratitude, making this a truly enriching experience.</p>

            is committed to nurturing selfless individuals who contribute to the safety and security of the community. 
            Through engaging activities and meaningful experiences, our cadets develop strong character, leadership, and resilience,

            integrity, resourcefulness, tenacity, and civic consciousness, fostering a sense of responsibility and pride. 
            Cadets gain unique insights into the Singapore Police Force (SPF) through interactions with officers at Neighbourhood 
            Police Centres and visits to various police establishments. To broaden their knowledge and skills, cadets participate 
            in specialized courses, including Anti-Drug Abuse, Basic Law, Crime Prevention, Crime Scene Investigation, First Aid, 
						Police Procedures, and SG Secure. </p>
            <p><strong>These experiences enrich their learning journey, shaping them into capable and community-conscious individuals.</strong>
