<h3>Mini Durian Delights</h3>

<p>The air buzzed with anticipation when a hint of its presence was dropped through a text message. Upon its arrival, the atmosphere intensified; some rushed up to it with their like-minded colleagues, while others scrunched up their noses yet politely declined, saying, ‘I would give it a miss.’ It is none other than the king of fruits – durian!</p>

<p>On the 28th of June 2024, staff were greeted by the strong and distinct aroma of durians. Enthusiasts revelled in its rich and creamy texture, especially in the company of other durian lovers at the Heritage Gallery. Whether the unique aroma elicited adoration or aversion, everyone had either the king of fruits or other delectable fruits to savour that day. While durians may reign supreme in the hearts of many fruit lovers, they did not overshadow the significance of the shared experience among us in the teaching fraternity.</p>

<h3>Embracing the Spirit of Hari Raya</h3>

<p>Hari Raya festivities are synonymous with an exquisite array of culinary delights. It was no exception this year, with the primary aim of fostering YCKSS familial ties. On 19 April, as the aroma of tantalising lunch filled the air, it set the perfect backdrop for colleagues to engage in hearty conversations amidst their busy lives.</p>

<p>Gathered in the cozy comfort of the Dance Studio 2, we revelled in the light-hearted stories steeped in history and practices of Muslims. While it culminated in quizzes that challenged our knowledge and wit, the winners brought home some mementos that served as vivid reminders of the generosity and inclusivity embedded within the Muslim culture.</p>

<h3>Chinese New Year Celebrations 2024</h3>

<p>To usher in the Year of the Dragon, all YCKSS staff convened in a calligraphy session on 2 February 2024. Empowered with creative autonomy, everyone carefully and meticulously penned auspicious words of their choice and engaged in the delicate art of paper cutting, reflecting personalised aspirations. The celebration would not be complete without the venerable tradition of Lo Hei on 16 February 2024, when a myriad of ingredients were tossed with one collective purpose: ringing in peace and prosperity in the coming year.</p>

<h3>EAS Learning Day</h3>

<p>Did you spend the December holidays cooking up a storm in the kitchen? For the EAS, 2 December 2020, was the day they donned aprons and became chefs in a special culinary workshop they attended in school. Look at the all the dishes they managed to whip up! Stuffed Portobello mushroom, chicken sliders, brownies, and cheesecake cups. Is your mouth watering yet?</p>

<h3>Joy of Learning</h3>

<p>When was the last time you felt like a complete amateur when learning a new skill, feeling the joy (and the 
embarrassment) of being a complete novice with that willingness to look foolish, to struggle and ask questions, and to be mediocre at something yet be unafraid to experiment and try?</p>

<p>1 September 2021, Wednesday was the **Joy of Learning Day**, a day of making learning fun, engaging and challenging for staff. It was planned by SWC in collaboration with the Design &amp; Technology unit. Instructions were given online for staff to have an exciting journey to create a "Magic Box".</p>

<p>The staff room was abuzz with activity, laughter, questions and that occasional 'squeal'.</p>

    <p>At the durian feast held on 31st July 2019, our staff were spoiled for choices. With a variety of fruits to choose from, the King of fruits was definitely the favourite. Staff who tried the Mao Shan Wang (MSW) durian, known to be the premium type, commented on its rich, bitter and heavily rich flavour.</p>
    <p>It was indeed a great way to end the day and we had an enjoyable bonding session over the feasting.</p>

            <h3>Celebration of Learning Day</h3>
	The objectives of the annual Celebration of Learning Day are as follows:

	* To celebrate and affirm the meaningful work done by PLTs since 2021 Term 3.
	* To provide a platform for PLTs to share and learn from each other.
	* To allow PLTs to gather feedback and suggestions to improve on the lesson design and refine their tech-enabled learning activities.

	
The Celebration of Learning Day employed the Blended Learning approach with VP Mr Kevin Lim delivering his opening remarks via the Zoom Platform while the showcase of PLT lesson packages by 21 teams was conducted face-to-face in separate classrooms for safe distancing in 2021.
