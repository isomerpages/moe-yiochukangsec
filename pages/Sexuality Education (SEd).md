                                            <p>
                                                1. Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools aims to enable students to
                                                understand the physiological, social and emotional changes they
                                                experience as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships
                                                with others, including those with members of the opposite sex, and make
                                                wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters. SEd is
                                                premised on the importance of the family as the basic unit of society.
                                                This means encouraging healthy, heterosexual marriages and stable
                                                nuclear family units with extended family support. The teaching and
                                                learning of SEd is based on respect for the values and beliefs of the
                                                different ethnic and religious communities in Singapore on sexuality
                                                issues.
                                            </p>
                                            <div>2. The <strong>Goals</strong> of Sexuality Education are to:

																								sexuality matters.</li>
                                            <li>Help students develop a moral compass and respect for themselves and
                                                others by having positive mainstream values and attitudes about
                                                sexuality that are premised on the family as the basic unit of society.

																							</ul>
																							</div>
                                            <div>3. The <strong>Key Messages</strong> of Sexuality Education are:
                                            <ul style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
																							<li>Love and respect yourself as you love and respect others;</li>
																							<li>Build positive relationships based on love and respect (which are
                                                the foundation for strong families);
                                            </li>
                                            <li>Make responsible decisions for yourself, your family and society;
																							and</li>
																							<li>Abstinence before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV
                                                and unintended pregnancies. Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your
                                                loved ones.

                                                6. The values and attitudes of our youth towards sexuality are
                                                increasingly shaped by their peers, exposure to the media, popular
                                                culture and the internet. Adolescence is a complex stage in life as the
                                                adolescent attempts to find his or her own identity and often struggles
                                                with new social relationships. The period of middle adolescence
                                                (generally from 15 – 17 years old) can be a turbulent period for
                                                adolescents. The gap between physical and emotional/cognitive maturity
                                                may result in a tendency to act on impulse, experiment with various
                                                activities (including sexual activities), sometimes without
                                                understanding the unpleasant consequences that may arise from such
                                                experimentation. The need for peer acceptance can be overwhelmingly
                                                strong and hinder one's ability to act responsibly. Given the pressures
                                                faced by the middle adolescent from within themselves and from peers, it
                                                is important to build a strong sense of self-worth, personal conviction
                                                and an understanding of the possible consequences of sexual behaviour.

                                                7. Through the Sexuality Education lessons, secondary students will have
                                                the opportunity to develop a positive self-esteem, develop their
                                                character, and expand their understanding and repertoire of skills to
                                                deal with various issues related to sexuality, which are of prime
                                                concern at this age.

                                            <p>
                                                8. <em>eTeens</em> is a programme developed by Health Promotion Board,
                                                in collaboration with the Ministry of Education, to provide Secondary 3
                                                students with accurate information on STIs, HIV and protection from a
                                                health perspective. <em>eTeens</em> is conducted in two segments – a
                                                mass talk segment and a classroom-based programme. The desired outcome
                                                of the <em>eTeens</em> programme is that students are empowered to make
                                                wise, informed and sensible decisions.
                                            </p>

                                                9. Students are taught skills such as decision-making, assertiveness and
                                                negotiation to say "no" to sex and negative peer pressure. They also
                                                learn that the impact of STIs/HIV extends beyond themselves and involves
                                                their family, and the importance of responsible decision-making and
                                                seeking help. Abstinence and upholding family values are the key
                                                messages.
