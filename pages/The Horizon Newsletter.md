The Horizon is published twice a year, one for each semester. It features events big and small that students participate in. Students’ reflections of their learning and challenges are also documented. The photographs capture students in action and their joy in learning both in and out of school. Sometimes, the students are the guest writers of the articles. Don't miss out our issues each semester to be kept informed on what YCKSS students experience in school. You can also find this on our [YCKSS FACEBOOK PAGE](https://www.facebook.com/yiochukangsec).

Here's our latest edition of Horizon 2023. Read how our students and staff continue to adapt and adjust to the every changing environment through our various involvement in the school activities and events.

### Journey Through 2020

In 2020, in the year of COVID-19, instead of an e-newsletter, we decided to create a documentary to capture in film the rich narratives of different students and staff.

Here are 3 videos that document the personal stories as we navigated this challenging yet meaningful journey together through the different stages in managing the disruption to learning.
