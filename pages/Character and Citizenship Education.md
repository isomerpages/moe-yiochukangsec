                The goal of Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is to inculcate
                values and build competencies in our students to help them grow to be
                good individuals and useful citizens. In Yio Chu Kang Secondary School,
                every teacher is a CCE teacher who engages the students to develop
                knowledge, skills and attitude to make informed and responsible choices
                in their lives.</p>
            <p>This is done through CCE lessons where our teachers
                facilitate students' learning for building positive character and
                citizenry according to the following themes.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Leader Within</li>
                <li>Family Our Foundation</li>
                <li>Being a Positive Influence</li>
                <li>Thinking Hearts, Feeling Minds</li>
                <li>U &amp; I in the Community</li>
                <li>This is Home Truly</li>
                <li>The World in Singapore</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                To develop social and emotional competencies in students, the following
                programmes are incorporated into CCE lessons:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cyber Wellness</li>
                <li>Education and Career Guidance</li>

            <p>
                Education and Career Guidance (ECG) is about engaging, inspiring and
                challenging students to develop aspirations and plan proactively for
                their future. The acquisition of knowledge about self and opportunities
                in education and work will enable students to apply decision-making
                skills and develop plans to achieve their career aspirations and life
                goals. Through ECG, social emotional competencies such as proactivity,
                adaptability and resilience are developed to prepare students for the
                21st Century workforce.
            </p>
            <div>
                <p>Through the ECG Curriculum, we aim to:</p>

                    <li>
                        enable students to synthesise information gathered from relevant

                Time in the curriculum is put aside to introduce students to information
                about careers and future education options. We encourage students to
                take ownership of their own learning and development, and understand the
                importance of continued learning as they progress beyond secondary
                school years.

                that they might be interested in and chart their educational pathways to

                National Education is experienced through the 4 key NE celebrations that
                are run throughout the year. Total Defence Day, International Friendship
                Day, Racial Harmony Day and National Day.

            <p>
                Through a variety of activities ranging from learning packages to
                cultural displays and parades, students immerse themselves in the
                uniqueness that is Singapore.
            </p>
            <p>
                The NE Unit also seeks for opportunities to work with partners to
                enhance the celebrations. Partners we have worked with include Parents
                and the International Students Integration Programme group.

            <h3>MOE Sexuality Education in Schools</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools aims to enable students to
                    understand the physiological, social and emotional changes they
                    experience as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships
                    with others, including those with members of the opposite sex, and make
                    wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters. SEd is
                    premised on the importance of the family as the basic unit of society.
                    This means encouraging healthy, heterosexual marriages and stable
                    nuclear family units with extended family support. The teaching and
                    learning of SEd is based on respect for the values and beliefs of the
                    different ethnic and religious communities in Singapore on sexuality
                    issues.
                </li>
                <li>The <strong>Goals</strong> of Sexuality Education are to:

                        <li>Support students in managing their physiological, social and
                            emotional changes as they grow up and develop safe and healthy
                            relationships.</li>
                        <li>Guide students to make wise, informed and responsible decisions on
                            sexuality matters.</li>
                        <li>Help students develop a moral compass and respect for themselves and
                            others by having positive mainstream values and attitudes about
                            sexuality that are premised on the family as the basic unit of society.

            <ol start="6">
                <li>The values and attitudes of our youth towards sexuality are
                    increasingly shaped by their peers, exposure to the media, popular
                    culture and the internet. Adolescence is a complex stage in life as the
                    adolescent attempts to find his or her own identity and often struggles
                    with new social relationships. The period of middle adolescence
                    (generally from 15 – 17 years old) can be a turbulent period for
                    adolescents. The gap between physical and emotional/cognitive maturity
                    may result in a tendency to act on impulse, experiment with various
                    activities (including sexual activities), sometimes without
                    understanding the unpleasant consequences that may arise from such
                    experimentation. The need for peer acceptance can be overwhelmingly
                    strong and hinder one's ability to act responsibly. Given the pressures
                    faced by the middle adolescent from within themselves and from peers, it
                    is important to build a strong sense of self-worth, personal conviction
                    and an understanding of the possible consequences of sexual behaviour.

                    Through the Sexuality Education lessons, secondary students will have
                    the opportunity to develop a positive self-esteem, develop their
                    character, and expand their understanding and repertoire of skills to
                    deal with various issues related to sexuality, which are of prime
                    concern at this age.

            <h4>eTeens Programme:</h4>
            <ol start="8">
                <li><em>eTeens</em> is a programme developed by Health Promotion Board,
                    in collaboration with the Ministry of Education, to provide Secondary 3
                    students with accurate information on STIs, HIV and protection from a
                    health perspective. <em>eTeens</em> is conducted in two segments – a
                    mass talk segment and a classroom-based programme. The desired outcome
                    of the <em>eTeens</em> programme is that students are empowered to make
                    wise, informed and sensible decisions.
                </li>
                <li>Students are taught skills such as decision-making, assertiveness and
                    negotiation to say "no" to sex and negative peer pressure. They also
                    learn that the impact of STIs/HIV extends beyond themselves and involves
                    their family, and the importance of responsible decision-making and
                    seeking help. Abstinence and upholding family values are the key
                    messages.

            <p>Our Secondary 1 students had a meaningful opportunity to learn about water conservation in an authentic way by participating in Waterway Watch Society’s River Monster Programme. As part of the activity, they carried out litter-picking along the shores of Marina Reservoir.</p>
            <p>This hands-on experience enabled them to observe the real impacts of litter on our waters and reflect on the vital role they can play in conserving Singapore’s precious water resources as they learnt that what happens upstream affects the downstream areas.</p>
            <p>They brought their learning back to their Geography classrooms where they analysed the water quality through the pH and turbidity of other sites along the Kallang River before coming up with an action plan for the community.</p>
