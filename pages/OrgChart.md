<summary><strong>NT Learning Journeys (NTLJ)</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The NTLJ is an integral component of the NT curriculum. Every fortnight,
all NT classes will spend three hours at a learning journey venue outside
of school. The objectives of the NTLJ programme are to create meaningful
and authentic learning experiences for the NT students, develop a love
for learning and equip them with a deeper knowledge and understanding of
the world around them.</p>
<p>The learning journeys are planned to centre on three themes:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Discovering our Past (Secondary 1)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experiencing the Present (Secondary 2)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Charting our Future (Secondary 3 and 4).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Syllabus objectives from curriculum subjects such as Social Studies, Elements
of Business Skills and English Language are also incorporated in the learning
journeys. Subject teachers design tasks for the learning journey venues
so that students are able to make connections between their learning in
school with real-world experiences.</p>
<p>The learning journeys are also aligned to the CCE outcomes, especially
in the area of Education and Career Guidance (ECG) for our Secondary three
and four students.</p>
<p>The students are given various tasks and questions to complete for every
learning journey. Students develop critical thinking through reflective
questions posed in the NTLJ tasks for each venue. These questions and tasks
are framed using Elements of Thought (e.g. point of view, implications
and consequences) and aim to grow students to become reflective thinkers
and learners.</p>
