description: From Ideas To Action (F.I.T.A.) is an innovative multidisciplinary
  STEM programme that empowers students to tackle real-world challenges by
  integrating knowledge from Humanities, Design & Technology, Mathematics, and
  Science. Through inquiry-based learning and Design Thinking, students apply
  RICE (Reflective, Inventive, Critical, Empathetic) Thinking Skills to develop
  thoughtful, practical solutions. By working collaboratively on authentic
  performance tasks, they deepen their understanding of environmental and
  societal issues while enhancing critical thinking and empathy. F.I.T.A.
  nurtures curiosity, creativity, and cross-disciplinary thinking — shaping
  tomorrow’s problem-solvers and changemakers through meaningful, hands-on
  learning experiences.

<p>From Ideas To Action (F.I.T.A.) is a multidisciplinary <i>Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM)</i> programme designed to allow students to synthesize knowledge across four subject disciplines, viz. Humanities, Design &amp; Technology, Mathematics and Science, and apply it to real-life situations. The philosophy underpinning the F.I.T.A. curriculum is that technological advancement and discovery in the real world rely on close collaboration between researchers, mathematicians, engineers, and innovators.</p>
	
<p>The authentic performance tasks embedded in the F.I.T.A. curriculum enable students to develop and hone the RICE (Reflective, Inventive, Critical, Empathetic) Thinking Skills. Working collaboratively in groups to carry out these tasks, students not only need to think critically when applying their knowledge to innovate but they also need to empathise with people holding different perspectives and consider the implications of their actions through active reflection.</p>
	
Through a combination of Design Thinking methodology and inquiry-based learning, students apply the RICE Thinking Skills framework to explore and develop innovative solutions to current and emerging challenges. This approach fosters deeper engagement with STEM, cultivates critical thinking, and enhances their awareness of environmental issues, empowering them to tackle real-world problems with curiosity and creativity.
